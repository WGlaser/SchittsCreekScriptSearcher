kids, it's garbage day.oh good, ours is full.okay, i've told youboth a thousand times,tie up the bags and leavethem outside your door!okay, but i like, justput something in itthat made it full, though.yeah, and you're already wearingyour little gloves, though.okay, do me a favour, david,and don't mention this to dad,'cause i haven't chosen my courses yet,and if he finds out he'sjust gonna like, buzz arounduntil i ask him his opinion.and no offense to him,but i don't want it.this is the samecollege where malala gavethat devastatingcommencement speech, right?
