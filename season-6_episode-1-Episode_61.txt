see youaimlessly wanderingthrough life.stoic but stymied,not a friend in the worldand so very lost.well, you're here now,moira,and... so am i.and, with your careerbehind you,we'll be able totake advantageof more days like this.does this not remind youof that wellness retreatwe went to in evian,right after alexis endedthings with sean penn?yes. you and i wandered downto the lake,ne'ery a person to be found.bid adieu to our clothingand let the cool stingof the mineral waterremind us that we were,in fact,alive and well.i lost my patek philippein that lake,but i wouldn't have had itany other way.we seem to have foundourselves alone again,mr. rose.- moira, that was 15 years ago!- mmhm?what if someone sees us?who knows what will befall ustomorrow, john?you could be hitby a mack truck,or bopped on the head bya tiny piece of space debris!i don't know,it feels risky.let me just attendto one thing first.moira, whatever it is canwait.no, no. before we re-baptizeourselvesi'm going to call my agentand make it official!moira rose is tech un-avail,she has a life to live.i'm proud of you,sweetheart.you just remove thosevetements, mr. rose,i'll be back in the shakeof a lamb's rump.as soon as i find a signal.ugh! ugh!uh! like...- what's going on over there?- i'm trying to check in!if we're going to be late,i'm going to at least doeverything i canto not miss my flight,because i have never neededa vacation more.yeah, this?i think this is what might bebothering your brother.okay, i get it,my life is an inconvenience.that. um,or the fact that you've beentalking nonstopabout how desperateyou are to get out of here?i think it might be hurtinghis feelings.okay. i'm moving to a placethat doesn't have a sephorafor literally 2700 miles,so i'm sorry if i'm tryingto convince myselfthat i'm doingthe right thing.i might still bea bit boozy,- yes, i can confirm that.- but...i've actually been jealousof your trip.like, you're getting out there,seeing the world.and now thatcabaret's over,i feel like i might needto be doing more of that.i just wish i had your...what's going on?because i thinki might bein the middle of giving youa compliment- for the first time, so.- yes,and i am super touched,it's just thati'm having trouble gettingmy boarding pass.like, do they not let peoplein economy check infor the flight?can i see your phone?okay. um, think i've

7th.what?why it's so?ugh, and my stupid ticketdoesn't allow for any changes.ugh!what am i supposed to do?well, maybe you could startby telling davidthat you messed up and he canbook the venue after all!okay, i would literallyrather sleep at the airport- for a month.- yeah.can you hear me now?no, i'm not blockingthe microphonewith my finger anymore!okay, no i was.now... yes?oh, well, what would

ma'am,i'm officer cornwall.i was off duty when i cameacross this manin a state of undress,down by the creek.he claims to beyour husband?last i checked,a decades-long successfulmarriageis not a criminal offence.no, no it is not.however, indecent exposurecertainly is.i found your husband sunninghimself in the creek,like he was in somegrecian bath.no, i don't think we needto editorialize.john, i'm so sorry,i was engrossed in a verystirring phone call.officer, perhaps we couldarrange a plea bargain?well, since i wasn't supposedto be fly fishingat this end of the creek...i think we can leave
