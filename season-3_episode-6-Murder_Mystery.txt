corrected by chriske ---- synced by the_foe (for dzejpi) --1:00 p.m., terrific.yeah, looking forward.bye.did somebody book a room?even better, someone might book a room.how is that better?a lot of people might booka room if this goes through.okay, but you're stillusing the word "might."that was the elm glen golf club.they wanna put togethera package with us.a weekend of golf,and a stay at a luxurious motel.what motel is that?i'm gonna let themwork out the verbiage,but the upshot is this,on a $250 dollar package,a cool $40 goes into our pockets.that sounds like a better deal for them.well, it's all aboutbuilding bridges, stevie.but here's the thing,even if this deal falls through,we still get an afternoonon a golf course!"we?"this is a big day for us, stevie!you know it's been three yearssince i've played a round of golf?yeah, um... golf's not really my thing.except there was thisone point in high schoolwhere i got this haircutthat everyone saidmade me look like i was in the lpga.well listen, i'm sure you could usean afternoon outdoors, okay?think of it as ateam-building exercise.okay.i might even let you drive the cart.- can you drink on the cart?- yeah.well, i will get the"back in 15 minutes" sign.well, it's gonna takelonger than 15 minutes.you have to give people hope.so, mrs. rose,i don't mean to pressure you,but i am anxious to know...understandably, yes,blt please, no bread.oh, i meant if you were comingto the murder mystery party.oh that, yes.yes, you are?it's just that it's theend of the week twyla,so that's always chockablock.and then there are the kids...well, both of them,david, alexis.well, i know you're busy,i was just-i don't know,i was just hoping you'dbring a little somethingto the party.a touch of celebrity, perhaps.- i was actually thinking bagel bites.- ah!did i mention it was a potluck?oh, you most certainly did not.well, i would ask someone else,it's just that uh, sofar no one is coming.no one's coming to your party?well, in fairness, the partyis still a few hours away.and some people did saythat if another thingthat's supposed tohappen doesn't happen,then they might be able to come,so, that's good.so as of now you have noone on your guest list?well, i shouldn't have said no one,my mom will come.and she'll probably bringwhoever she's dating.and he'll most likelybring some younger friend.twyla, this is unacceptable!there are myriad tactics toboost numbers at your party!well, you start by compinga few influential guests.you'd be shocked at how manycelebrities show up to a thingwith the promise of a free wagyu slider.i-i'm not charging anyone,this is just for fun.oh, this is worse than i assumed!how about a signature cocktail?i hadn't thought of that.- okay, shouldn't you be...- oh, yeah.okay, we're going tostart with follow-up.you secure your vip list,and you work your way down from there.- hi.- hi.where's stevie?um, i don't know, but shewill be back in 15 minutes.what are you doing?i'm just checking the mail.did you know you can still get mail?yes, i know about mail.no, but i'm talkingabout like, mail, mail.like a little man in a uniform,with his satchel full of letters,traveling door to door.um, that's a mailman.and he comes to your house, you pay him,and he gives you your stuff.i think it's free delivery, david.- i don't think so...- mmm!how far into the 15minutes do you think we are?okay, don't take this the wrong way,but you've just been kind ofhanging around a lot lately,- which isn't a bad thing,- mhmm...but it's also not a good thing.yeah, um...it's just that the town onlyhas so many ex-boyfriendsto hand out secretary work.um, first of all, david,- i'm an assistant, not a secretary,- oh.and second of all, tedis not my ex-boyfriend,he is ex-fiance.and i'll have you know,that i might not be anassistant for much longer.what is this?- it's elmdale college.- ooh.ted and i have beentalking about me doing like,an accounting course,or an office management course,but i think i can maybebroaden my horizons a bit.you've circled "stars and cosmology?"oh yeah, i thoughtit said "cosmetology."ugh!can i just... for a sec?here is jocelyn's visor,and her glove.oh, uh, i don't thinki'm gonna be playing,but thanks.okay, you know what, justin case you change your mind,why don't i show you a few pointers?i can do it right here on johnny.oh, i don't think so.i mean, a few pointers couldn't hurt.- oh, i-i don't think that necessary.- here, come on, jonathan.- okay, whoa.- come on down.right there, let me see your stance,what do you got goin' here?well, the set up isvery important, stevie.uh, legs so far apart,- knees slightly bent.- ooh!make sure you're nice andbalanced over the ball.yeah, woo!johnny, i gotta tell you,you have a sensational stance.well, i've been golfingfor 30 years, roland.wow, i like that.there's one thing i don't like about it,and let me show it to you.i don't think i was asking.well, i think it's betterthat we show stevie,than just talk about it, don't you?right, okay, so just first off,spread your legs just a littlewider, if you would, for me.- all right.- there, see, stevie?they've gotta be like, sortof even with the shoulders,and if you would justpop the old tush...just go, bam!that's it, and nowloosen up a little bit.- okay.- yeah!all right, you know what,roland, i think...i should be showing you,because i don't really think you knowwhat you're... doing.- yes, right.- okay now, grip, very important.- yeah?- are you using the vargon grip?i'm using la va grande.are you watching this, stevie?yeah, this is just alittle hard to understand,so i want a record of it.- okay, delete that, please!- can i get a copy of that?yeah.- oh hi, moira.- hi.i thought that rolandmight still be here.no, it seems our mayoris keeping summer hours.gotcha.jocelyn...it's really good tosee you out and about.yes, i was starting to worry.- why?- well, i happened to be chattingwith our dear little twylaabout her party tonight,and she mentioned thatyou have yet to rsvp?and i thought, that'snot the jocelyn i know.what must've felled her?i'm fine, here's the thing.these parties are not great.last year it went until 3 am,and twyla just wandered aroundkind of winking at everybody,until she realized shehadn't picked a murderer.and then the year beforethere were three murderers,and one of themactually robbed the cafe!well, i hear this year isgoing to be very different.twyla apparently sought counsel.expect thoughtful party favors,themed cocktails,first class catering.i thought it was a potluck?you, jocelyn, are the mayor's wife,you are the self-appointedleader of the jazzigals,and most importantly,twyla worships you.- she does?- yes.this party has real momentum now.and with you attached,it's no less than asnowball gathering speed,picking up bodies as it rolls downhill.- and that's good?- very good.well, i guess i could talkto the other jazzigals.i just wish i hadn't thrownout that flapper dressfrom halloween last year.- oh!- spread the word!be the snowball.be the snowball!okay, it's just that i misplacedmy high school diplomawhen we lost our house.no, i wish it was a flood.okay well, chasing down the paperworkseems like a lot of work.no, i know that...i know that your coursesrequire a lot of work,i'm just... what if it was a flood?okay fine, i will call youback with the paperwork, thanks.um, what's going on?are you looking at courses now?um, i'm just putting some feelers out.a lot of people have encouraged meto build on the skills iacquired as creative directorof the blouse barn, so.like who?i thought it could be good for me.okay, well, this issort of my thing, though.i really don't thinkyou can claim educationas your thing,and i don't even think i'llbe able to take those courses,because the stupid people at the collegewouldn't just take my wordfor it when i told themthat i had a high school diploma.but why do you need it, though?to prove that i graduated high school.well, it's not likethey're gonna be like,"oh, you don't haveyour high school diploma,you can't come to our college."that's almost word for wordwhat they just said to me on the phone.well...i just don't think ihave that kind of time.- okay, what are you doing?- reorganizing my knits!- oh, there they are.- oh.mr. rose, ms. budd.yes, please call me johnny.always nice to put a face to the name.oh, i see you two camedressed for the occasion.always ready.- i like your visor.- thanks, it's new.so i hear there's quite a fewnew developments at your motel.uh, we'd love to hear about them,why don't we have a seat?oh, you wanna have the meeting inside?on a day like this?sorry, did you thinkwe'd be playing a round?oh, no, no, no, no, no.we-we had a meetingearlier at another club,and they wanted us totest drive the course,so... we're in the attire.oh, where were you playing?uh, we were playing at um...it was what course, stevie?it was down the road.uh, maple...- grove?- grove, maple grove.maple grove?no, i don't know that one.oh, really? it's a beautiful course.very exclusive, uh, but it is set...way back off the road, it's...which might explainwhy you've never seen- or heard of it.- yeah.so every room will have wi-fi,and upgraded beds,uh, working toilets,which probably sounds likesomething i don't needto mention but you know,just covering all the bases.well, that sounds great.well, it's just that um...we've been talking tothe elmington moto-lodge,and they've got coinlaundry, and a jacuzzi.well, we can certainly put in a jacuzzi.yeah, jacuzzis are verypopular with our golfers.well, as an avid golfer myself,i can tell you that whenyou buy a golf package,you don't necessarily wantto spend the entire weekendsitting in your room.well, thanks for coming by.and definitely let us knowwhen you've got that jacuzzi.yes, we uh, we will.i guess that's all,that's it now, thanks.yeah, well, listen, it's uh still early,do you guys have anyother plans this afternoon?we have another meeting.oh well, you know what they say,too much work...- well, thanks for coming in.- okay.you go on ahead, i'm justgonna go use the restroom.oh sure, might as welluse some of the amenities.hey.um, you know those courseswe were talking about?oh yeah, i thoughtthat data management onelooked like it might be good for you.mhmm, yeah, i had the same thought,but when i looked into it,all the courses were full.and then the courses that weren't fullconflicted with each other,and then everything just canceled out.alexis, if you don'twanna take the course,you don't have to take the course.no, there were courses thatdid look very interesting.um, it's just kind of complicated.yeah, but it's so worth it.sometimes i wish icould go back to college.pub nights, frisbee in the quad...- hmm!- late night hacky sack.mhmm.we got some serioussack circles going.oh, so many sex circles.sack. hacky sack.we always hoped they'd lead to sex,but... still.college, so crazy.so crazy.um...okay, the thing is...i can't go to college,yet.because i didn't finish high school.- oh.- i know.it's so embarrassing, andi never should've takenthat semester off.but i did meet beyonce in mykonos,so it was almost worth it.didn't you say on your resumethat you did four years at ucla?yes... technically,if you consider bel airan extension of the campus,which everybody does.this might sound crazy,but i almost think ishould finish high school.that... doesn't sound crazy at all.and truth be told,it took me a minute tofinish high school myself.you're only saying thatto make me feel better.no, no, me and some friends,we just got in a car,- and took off.- really?yeah, we were followingthe american idol tour.we missed a couple shows,but it's always the exact same set,so... no regrets.um, i really wish you hadn'ttold me that last little bit,but... thank you.that makes two of us.- good round?- not bad.greens are a littlefast, but i like that.me too.i've given a heads-up to the starter.the tee is yours.- have a great round, you two.- thanks so much.how did you make that happen?i asked.well, that's very nice, stevie!thank you.okay, let's get our golf sticks.david,and why am i not surprisedto see you in here?well, this is my room.well, it's dishearteningto see you like this.did you know that according to imdb,rosa parks was in an episodeof "touched by an angel?"exactly, david.you are bored, lethargic,and practically dripping with ennui!okay, that's a bit much.i blame myself.i've set a standard ofactivity and engagementso high you don't even try.okay, i am on a much needed respitewhilst in between jobs.you are squandering your social capital.a taste-maker like youshould be out there,tasting things!uh, i'm at the buffet,and there is nothing to taste!well, there's a partytonight, as a matter of fact.- the murder mystery thing?- why not?does this town not deserveto have a marquee guestlike yourself grace their humble soiree?speaking of marquee guests,i'm surprised you're going.i can understand why you'd say that,but... don't you just knowtwyla would be thrilledto have as many rosesthere tonight as possible!fine, i will make a surprise appearance.- good.- but it's twice around the room,- and then i'm out.- is there any other way?oh, and it's roaring twenties themed,and i know you have asoft spot for seersucker.- i won't be dressing up.- aw, say, don't be a dew-dropper!throw some concealerunder those peepers,make like a swell,and go put on the ritz!- woo.- good golf shot!thank you, stevie.ah...oh!john, are you going to

throw a fiascountil i exerted my influence.uh yeah, and the way twyla keeps askingabout where you are,i'm pretty sure you're the murderer.then they'll never catch me.ugh!who was that?i don't know.alexis, we sent you tohigh school in switzerlandbecause we trusted you!that school cost $250,000 dollars!i know, and i felt so bad about it.and that is why imissed my final semester.wait a
