no. no! it's too much!- okay, then i guesswe can just...tell her we're gettingoutside help.- mm, good luck.when she was coaching me forthe "little mister" pageant,i made the mistake of goingto mario lopez for advice,he was the hosting at the time.anyway, she found out,and felt so betrayed,she "forgot" to double-knotmy tap shoes,and cost me the crown.so i will cover for youfor one more night.but

time for me, then yes.- no actually, i've beenthinking about maybetaking a longer break from work.- i'm listening.- what if we got out of town,just the two of us?- like thelma and louise?- nope.uh no, i was thinking somewheremore exotic, like,i don't know, somewhere thatwould have beaches for you,and some interesting wildlifefor me?- okay, i've just been to miamiso many times before,and trust me, the "wildlife"is not as sexy up close.- no, i'm talking aboutfarther away.like, i don't know...the galapagos islands.- i love that.- really?- yes, as a jumping-off point,yes!but if we're thinking islands,why don't we do somethingless sleepy and scary,like, the maldives?- definitely somethingto consider.and i guess while we'respit-balling here,you know, it could be kinda funto go somewherethat you've never been before.like, i don't know,the galapagos islands.- yes, ted! an islandsomewhere for sure.we just need to figure outwhere.but i'm so glad we're onthe same page about this!- yeah, yeah.and-and what page is that?- well, we both agreethat we wanna get away,and we both agree thatwe're gonna landon somewhere so good.mhmm!hey, johnny. i heard the news.boy, we are really goingto miss moira tonightat the annual mayor's roast.i was looking forwardto getting scorched.- oh yeah, well, she's gonnamiss it, too.- yeah, i mean,when she starts going off,oh my god, you better havethe burn unit on speed dial.i mean, get the fireextinguishers ready,because she is just slingingheat!which ultimately becomes fire.- yeah, i get it, i get it.she can, she can be funnyon occasion.- yeah, it's okay though,i've got uh, bob's cousin,louis, from elm county,he's gonna come inand fill in for her, so.- yeah well, louis' the lastguy that should be driving infor tonight. uh no, i-i uh...i'm more than capableof taking moira's place.- johnny, i don't think so.those are pretty high heelsto fill.- well, don't you worryabout me, i've uh...i've handled myself pretty wellhumorously speaking,in front of large crowds before.- jeez, if you bring upthat rose videoshareholder's meeting again...- you better be spending thistime toughening your skin,because i've got morethan a few...rippers up my sleevefor tonight.- okay um, first off, i haveno idea what "rippers" are.- well, maybe you'd know,if you graduated elementaryschool.- i can't believe you saidthat to me.- oh roland, i'm sorry, did i...was that too far?look at your face!"oh roland, i'm sorry,did i go too far?"oh pal, you are goingto get eaten alive tonight!oh!david! what are youdoing walking the streetsall by yourself?- you make me sound likea feral cat.i'm walking home.- don't tell me the storeis already laying off people!- no, patrick sent me hometo get a chequethat apparently is taxfor the government,and not, as i assumed,a bonus for me.- well, i'm glad i caught you,because i got your missiveabout wanting to supthis evening,and i'm afraid i must decline.- what? why? why?- david, full disclosure,you have been awfully clingyof late.- okay...i think it might be propitiousfor you to spendsome time with your peers.what's patrick doing tonight?or stevie?- they're um, busy.- busy? well, rehearsals endsharply at six,so either one of themshould be freeto dine with you thereafter.- i just don't think they'reavailable tonight.- hmm, too tired?- mm, yes. yeah.- yes.they've both been struggling.- yeah, that's-that's it.your choreography has beenworking them so hardthey basically just go homeand fall sleep,so actually your showis stripping meof a social life.- alright, david, but it'llhave to be a working repast.i could use your eye for thefinal design of the posters.okay? you employ the wrong font,and you may as well bid aufwiedersehen to ticket sales.- can't wait.- until then, dear!- we're both going home though!what the hell?!- alexis, you don't need to dothose dishes.- i didn't, i just put themon the counter.um, i also found thison the counter."charles darwin researchcenter."what is this?- oh, nothing.just-just some work stuff.- it says you were oneof ten people selectedfor a research program.- oh, what?that's... crazy.- is this why you kept bringingup those islands this morning?- oh, the galapagos islands?uh, not necessarily, no.- ted, why else would anyonewanna go there?- you mean, other than wantingto study some of the rarestand most diverse forms of plantand animal life on the planet?uh, yeah,i guess you have a point.- you were selected outof thousands of applicants?- it just means that they'llhave plenty of peopleto pick fromwhen i don't accept.- ted!why didn't you tell meyou were doing this?- because i applied beforewe got back together,and it takes a couple yearsto process the applications.- a couple years?it sounds important.- well, listen,it's not not important.but i can, i can alwaysapply again.you know, emmett,the tortoise is 180-years-old,so i'm sure he'll still bearound in another few years.- you love old tortoises!it sounds like a dream.how long is the program?- six months.- oh, wow.- yeah, see, this is whyi didn't wanna push iton you this morning, okay?because you mean way more to methan some dumb...once-in-a-lifetimejob opportunity.- ted, i don't know what to say.i'd totally think about it,but like,my laptop's here...- okay, honestly,just don't worry about it.- well, what aboutlong distance?i once maintained a successful,semi-committedtext relationshipwith josh hartnettwhile he was shooting"pearl harbor".- okay, alexis, i appreciateyour creative problem solving,but. you know, i-i wouldn'tstay if i didn't feellike it was... it wasthe right choice for me.- babe, are you sure?- yes.- but are you sure, sure?because i don't want you to notgo like, just because of me.- okay alexis, that's exactlywhat's happening,but it's fine, okay?and i told you that it's fine,so it's-it's fine!- okay.- okay.- okay... so we're all good,then.that was a good talkfor everyone.you know what i am gonna do?i'm gonna do those dishes.babe, do you have a dishwasher?okay, i'm just gonna...i'm gonna figure it out then.okay.- sounds like someone'sin a good mood.- what? me? oh.sorry, you know those dayswhere you're just like,super in love?- hmm, not really.- you will. anyway, i'm justthinking about ted and me.i can't believe we've come sucha long way, you know?- aww!- yeah. i just feel so luckyto be with someonewho would do anything for me.like, i just found out that hegot this crazy job opportunity,and he's turning it downjust to be with me.- wow. that is lucky.- he was ten people pickedout of like, ten thousand.- oh my god, and he's not going?- no, i think his perspectivewas that there would beother opportunities.- still, that must be totallyheartbreaking for him.but i guess relationshipsare all about sacrifice.- oh my god, yes,ted and i are so goodat that whole give and takething.like, he gives me so much,and i have learned to takeas well.- and i'm sure you givethings up for himall the time as well.- totally.but also, he never reallyasks me to,so that's hard for meto do for him.but if he did, i would.- oh, so he didn't ask youto go with him?- not technically.- okay.one day i hope i find a guylike ted.someone who would literallyput all their hopes and dreamsaside to be with me.- yeah.yeah. thanks for the chat, twy.you're like my littlefairy godmother,if she wore an apron,and celine dion's perfume.- oh, so i've got a lotof good material here,i just need some help siftingout the gold.- i still don't see whyyou dragged us into this.- well, you can be a toughaudience, ronnie.- what's that supposed to mean?- see?that's what i'm looking for,honest reactions.- well, i've been honestlyreacting quite stronglyto your aftershave.it's a bit too europeanfor my taste.- not the most helpfulfeedback, bob.- look, now that you've trappedus here, just...- what-what do you got, johnny?- okay, here we go.well, it's 1791, and threeexplorers have landed...- next.- i was flipping through thephone book the other day, and...- the phone book?how old are these?!- well, you're not evenletting meget to the punchlines, ronnie.- johnny, you need a searchand rescue teamto find the punchlinesfor those setups.- ah! top ten thingsyou don't want rolandten too many.johnny, you gotta be shortand quick,like roland in the bedroom.- now, that, that onekills every year.- oh no, i love that one,is that one up for grabs?- no. you've gotta gofor the jugular,just stay away from spouses,kids, and health,and you'll be fine.now, if you'll excuse me,i gotta get back to work,which, up until

seen meon fire, bob.- i'm glad i let you talk meinto another dinner, david.that note you had aboutincluding my nameon the poster as a sales tool,that's something i've beendebating for some time now.-

one thatshould be sorry.- no, i should've beenmore direct,and we should've just talkedthis through.and i actually did someresearch on the maldives,and there's this beautifulresort that we could stay

bespending a lot of timein tents, and there could bedisease-carryinginsects around, so.- okay. okay.um, this is still very fresh.i made this decision like,two minutes ago,so why don't we focusmore on the beach,and less on the details?- fair enough.- when it comes to makingdecisions,roland likes to go with his gut.and boy, does he have a lotof gut to go with.ohhhh!- yes, i do.- and look at bob,pretending to get it.and we all know gwen,he hasn't gotten it in years!ohhh!- oh, that-ronnie is justcrushing it!i mean, you know, everybodyreally has so far.- okay, okay, that's alli got for

uptonight, so.- hey, is that a crackabout my cooking?- from the guy who's hadfour helpings?yeah!- oh, and bob's joking about mehaving four helpings,we all know if you've evertaken your car to bob's garage,he's not necessarily known"four helpings" anyone.- well anyway, a coupleof little improvs thereto get started, but uh, uh...what was i saying?- nothing funny so far.- hey johnny, come on,i've got a white flag,why don't you just startwaving it?ohhh!- yeah, roland, may i point outthat i was quietwhen everyone else was up heredoing their roasts.- i wish you were quietright now!- well, things seemto be going downhill fast.which is what the town must'vebeen thinking when rolandelected himself mayor.- okay, i'll give him that.- oh, got a smile out of ronnie.the last time anyone sawher this happywas at a 3-for-1 saleon cargo pants!- where? where?- all right, johnny, startingto make some moves, now.- cargo, i said car-go,which is what a caris supposed to do...unless you take itto bob's garage!- well listen, i don't wantto overstay my welcome,i'll keep things shortand quick.which reminds me of the lasttime i was in roland's bedroom,um... well,i-i wasn't in roland's bedroom,but the...ah! what was it, ronnie?- just sit down, johnny.- well anyway, the punchlineis, it was short and quick.anyway, i'm gonna quitwhile i'm ahead, folks.- i think it's a little latefor that, pal.ohhh!- good job, johnny, all right.no, i wish you guyscould've been there tonight.i was really ripping into them.- yes, i'm sure you killedthem, dear,with all the venomof a silkworm.- oh, you know what, moira?jealousy doesn't look goodon you.much like that mirroredjumpsuit you woreto candy spelling's 50th!- john!- oh my god, dad!- why don't you take it easy,alexis,like you did withyour education?ugh!- i mean, he's not wrong.- oh, look at david.smart enough to get that joke,but not smart enoughto stop wearing sweatersin the middle of summer.- burn, david!- okay, here's why that jokedidn't work.- and look at you, john.a worthy competitor emerges.something the good peopleat blockbuster never saidabout rose video. ha! ha!- that was low,like david's standards.- or the placement
