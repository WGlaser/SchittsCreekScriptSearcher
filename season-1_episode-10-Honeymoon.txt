considerthe idea of um... getting a life.alexis, i would not concernyourself with your mother and me,because we have aflourishing social life here.walking over to thecafe and ordering a tuna meltis hardly what i would calla flourishing social life.oh, that's funny. that's funny.yeah, it's just that you're so involvedin our lives right now,and that was fine when we werechild actors for a little bit,but now david and i are grown up adults,and we're just feeling very like, um...- suffocated.- suffocated.- suffocated?!- wait, stop, stop!we came in here to speak about you two!what could you possibly have to say now?well, now i don't remember.yeah, i don't remember.oh my god! thanks.you know, the more i think about it,the more i wonder whether david's whole..."sexually adventurous"thing

relationship- where you find yourself cheating- yes!with someone in your dreams?oh, what?oh. um... you know thatif it's in your dreams,or over the clothes,it's not cheating, right?yeah well, it's

today,so we talked about that.you didn't tell me youwere having a bad day.- ted, this is delicious.- mm-hmm.i didn't mean a bad day, twy,i just meant like, hewas questioning things.thank you, stevie, i orderedit online from nevada.no sales tax.- what were you questioning?- it's nothing.so when the lasagna gets delivered,does it come frozen, or... ?okay, i just uh...i don't know why youdidn't feel

say.uh uh!so everyone knows?- knows what?- these two have...what an elegant gesture, ted.i-i'm sorry, i thought everyone knew.- no.- it's okay.sorry!i've been with these people before.i know them all.wow, you've really beengetting around town.no, i was with them in my other life.i'm gonna tell you something.i'm from a small town, just like this.no, i'm not buying that!- it's true.- really?why would you leave?oh god, i couldn't wait to get out.i was dying there.have you never dreamed?of a life beyond?you have what ifs, like, what if...i had enlisted in the military,what if roland hadn't

funny.i never said it was bad!okay, you know what i think is happening,is things are just gettingblown out of proportion,and honestly, if alexis,you just tell us what youand mutt were talking about,it'd probably help.oh my god, ted!we were just washing a car,and talking about bad dreams.- okay?- okay.you sound a little defensive.- i'd agree.- well...you know what, i just remembered,i have to wake up early tomorrow,i have an early check in.uh, nobody checks in.tomorrow someone is, early.uh ted, you have a really special place,and we should all do this again some time.david, would you mind walking me home,i don't think we're finished talking.oooh, david!don't!my son lives in a barnin the woods, by choice!he could be the next mayorof this town if he wanted it.my son is "pansexual."mm-hmm, i've heard of that.i know what that is, that's uh...that cookware fetish.- no.- mm-hmm!- no, no.- no, i read about that!no, he loves everyone, men, women,women who become men, men who become women.i'm his father, and i alwayswanted his life to be easy.but you know, just pickone gender, and maybe,maybe everything would'vebeen less... confusing.well... you know johnny,when it comes to matters of the heart,we can't tell our kids who to love.- who said that?- you did.when?- you just said it now!- when?now, right this second, you just said it.and you're right, you can't tell

out of dinner?yeah, i thought you were in on it.well, you deserve a daytimeemmy for that performance.thank you, i think so.okay, so you're not like,raging mad at me, then.no. i think it's fairto say that neither of ushave ever worked witha ceiling mirror before.- true.- it was funny!and a little humiliating.yeah, i uh...saw a lot of my body, and i didn't like it.- mm-hmm.- so...i'm actually that way.okay, yeah, i was um-wondering if maybe we should um...try it again, for the sake of practice?i'd be into that idea...for the sake of proficiency.so i guess we won't be playing headbandz.- why did you say that?- oh my god.what the helljust don't, just stay here.oh, hello again!spending another night together?dad!oh, stevie, i hope you're being smart.- oh my god!- oh my god!because we can't
