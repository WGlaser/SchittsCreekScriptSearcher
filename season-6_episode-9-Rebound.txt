bob was so upsethe had to go home.you know, moira,this bad presscould not have comeat a worse time.we were just about to launcha huge tourism campaign,and now thanks to you,this could be the biggestscandal since we installedthe church wheelchair rampbackwards.roland, somethinghas to be done!it's a simple miscommunication.do you want stevieto be cleaning eggs off my carevery morning?!moira, you're gonna haveto clean up this mess yourself,okay? we're spending a lotof money on this campaign,and we can't affordanother "ramp-gate."(sucks her teeth)(protestors mutter angrily)(booing, hollering)woman: why'd you do it?!- why'd you do it?!- ooh,i think they're herefor you, moira!hey uh, folks, i can't quiteread those signs,do you mind holding them upa little higher for me, there?oh yeah, thanks.you know what's often morepotent than an apology,is an explanation.you know, i may have saidthis town is the last placei wish to find myself,but the magazine neglectedto include my entire quote.i specifically commendedyour ever-beating heart,and your elephantinegenerosity."a slice of heaven," is whati recall myself saying!please know that i believe,deep down,there areworse places to be.like in your shoes right now.would a quick meet and greethelp?i do have a few headshotsin the boot of my car.no, i don't think you needmore people knowingwhich car is yours, moira,but i do have an ideathat i think will solveall our problems.okay, but can we discuss itover lunch?i pre-ordered a tuna sandwich,and those things can turnon a dime.oh, allow me to leave youwith this.i solemnly vow to make rightby all of you.as soon as one of you detailsmy car.(protesters exclaim angrily)receipt in the bag?there you go, bye.i don't wanna rub saltin the wound here, david,but

in the cornergiving her cut-eye.i'm mentoring her,and monitoring her progress.and frankly, it's not movingas fast as i'd like.why can't you just admitthat she is an asset?it's probably beginner'sluck,like when you walk intoa casino and win bigon your first pull of the"basic instinct" slot machine.okay, i'm beginning to thinkthat that is the high point- of your entire life.- all i'm saying is,i don't necessarily trustthe numbers.oh.i had an ex in san franciscowho was a real estate agent,and basically made allof our friends buy penthousesjust to make it look likehe was doing well.for all we know, these couldjust be jocelyn's friends.well, friends or not,that's still a sale.yeah, but is that whatwe're really about?like, just selling products?yep, that is literallythe purpose of our store.look, i didn't expect thisfrom jocelyn either,but clearly, she hasa connection to the peopleof this community,and i say we make the most of it.okay, so what,you want to offer her a job?well, i think the offer wouldmean more coming from you.another sale, boys!(bell jingles)where'd she get that bell?she brought it from home.(door shuts)(alexis groans)(door opens and slams

well...maybe-maybe that's just furtherconfirmationthat you know, he...he wasn't... he wasn'tthe right person for you?i know he's not the rightperson for me.his taste in makeout music,for example,like, so weird.like, who even is cat stevens?!well, cat wrote somewonderful songs, honey.i'm just looking for like,any distractionfrom the fact that my heart'sshatteredinto a million pieces.like, i don't
