thank you!and what did you think,clifton?i can't wait for the screener.so, i'm sure you're dying toknow what this is all about,and since this isn't sweepsweeks,i won't keep you hanging.my imagination has become- rather unbridled since you called.- hmm.let me guess.a reunion?no, it's much, much, much,much better.some sort of televised event?it's a panel?late night?they wanna reboot"sunrise bay!"what? who...no, no. it's a big, bigco-production.all the good people want in.moira, it's gonna be raw,it's gonna be edgy,and primetime!a sexy new cast,but they have askedfor prominent charactersfrom the original to groundthe whole thing.- so i called clifton...- alphabetical.- and he said...- i said,i wouldn't do it without you.and that was beforenicole kidman signed onas adriana's daughter.nicole kidman.and i was believing you bothup till now.no, no, no.m-moira this is all true.have you forgotten thatvivian was killed off?when has that ever stop us?but that last timei was shredded.that's why we have writers.let them do their magic.oops, oops.what do we have here?what is that? is this maybea very generous offerfor a direct to-seriesprimetime emmy contender.have a read.have a read of thatand then maybe meet upwith us later tonight?we can celebrateover drinks.i don't know what to say.it's a simple answer,vivian.say yes.(door opens) alexis!do i have news...okay,thank god you're herebecause i have so manyquestions.like, why did they kill offyour characterafter you had just given birthto your ninth childand escaped from the cave withthe secret about your lover...who was a ghost, yes....and then they killed off inlike the most humiliating way.i'm not sure i call ithumiliating.you vomited a demoninto a toilet,and then fell in and drowned.well, the writers insistedit was symbolic.- nevertheless, i have something...- and then they- shredded you.- yes.yes. i should have seenthat comingafter the contract demands but...- okay yes.re: that drama.i just fell down a darksunrise fan-holeand found this message boardabout conspiracy- theories. there are a lot of fans- oh alexis.who think clifton sparkshad you written off the showbecause he was jealous.don't be a dotty,poor alexis.no i, unwittingly negotiatedmyself off the show.end of story.okay.you watch this videoand tell me who you thinkhe's referring to then.(light taps)(frustrated groan)come.there has been someserious sunrise intriguearound the sudden departureof vivian blake.can you tell us what happened?(slurring) she had a good run.but let's just say "someone"reminded the producersthat there's only roomfor one head of surgeryat sunrise general.and i think allyou housewives at homeknow who that should be.see, he's basically admittingto having you written offthe show.no. he's drunk there.no. that's not...no, alexis i came hereto tell you something...i've been askedto resuscitate vivianso that she may live againin a primetime reboot.is clifton involved?alexis, he drove all this wayjust to personally beg meto acquiesce.hm. of course he did.you're the only personin the show making headlines- right now.- that's not true.adriana had that dui last year.popped a breasts, poor dearthey need you.and all i'm saying is,as your publicistand your daughter,and now the moderator ofthe "sunrise bay" fan forum,there's more to this story.and if you wanna go throughwith thisafter watching that video?just remember that thereis nothing wrongwith asking for what youdeserve.perhaps a little more houseworkand little less mouse workmight do you some good, alexis.but thank you for your pairof pennies.hmm.good news, stevie, i thinki may have found someonewho can do the fumigationfor half the price.his name's phil.he's got a lotof two-star reviews,but that's one more starthan the other guys.will the savings coverthe costof rebuilding the foundation?no. no they won't.so i guess the news isn'tthat good after all.- (door opens)- ooh, hi.hi. oh, still eatingthe tenderloin?well, they were just gonnathrow it out, david.oh.um, i noticed that therewas some awkwardnessearlier at the tasting,and i just got the sensethat you were uncomfortableabout something.(covering) oh?i don't know why you wouldthink that.penelope askedif you wanted to crackthe top of the creme brul√©eand you asked,"if we break it, do we buy it?"well, i think that was aperfectly legitimate questionconsidering i wasn't evenhungry after the beef.okay. i knowwhat's going on.- you do?- yeah, and don't worry,you don't have to coverthe cost of the extra table.that's eight plates than youhadn't budgeted for.plus patrick's parents ended upgiving us way more money- than we had expected.- oh.yeah. apparently there issome nest egg they set asidefor patrick and his ex-fianc√©e.so honestly you have to payfor anythingif it's going to be a strain.david,i said i would cover the food...okay.but if the brewers wanna payfor the extra table,then i think that's a wonderfulgesture form the brewers.great. what did i tell youabout that beef?- oh good.- right?- so good, right?- hmm.(door shuts)mr. rose,it's not gonna always belike this.you know, we had a sizablenest egg set asidefor david's wedding.he was talking about balifor a while.we were gonna chartersome jets.fly everybody.i'm gonna get some air, stevie.(receding footsteps)(door opens and shuts)(sighs)(crickets chirp)(low hum of chatter,music plays)please. you know,i'm not interested in that.room for one more?muffy, grab a chair.i hope you don't mind,we decided to get a head starton the celebration.extra dry?extra olive?oh, thank you,mr. bernstein!hey, tell that cute bartenderi'd love a sex on the beach.if she has time,i need another scotch.ha! you better hurryif you want to catch up.oh no, this doctor wouldrather nurse her potable,if you don't mind.best to stay lucidfor our congress.hey. remember how you enteredthat time machineyou discovered in thehospital's broom closet?season three?what if we bring you backthat way?(chuckles)it's not easy to disremembermy final demise.it was even more viciousthan vivian's getting trampledwhile honeymooningin pamplona.oh moira! get over it!contract negotiationsgo sour all the time!what do you know aboutmy contract?what?i believe i gave you a newcontract today.did you-did you bring it?- clifton...- hm?there are fanswho think thatyou might have had somethingto do withmy being written off the show.(laughs) what?! who?why would...?look, moira, there werea lot of egos back then,and i was different man.that was before my livertransplant.is it true?think of itas a compliment.your star was rising,and i was maybe jealous.oh, would you look at this.i'm getting textsfrom nicole's office.serves me right for sharingep credit. these people...i'm guessing, cliftonwas also responsiblefor my name beingrepeatedly left offthe daytime emmy ballot?no, we submitted youevery year.and-and that season thatyou played your own brotherwe submitted you forbest actress and actor.you did what?oh, tippy,i did not negotiate myselfout of the job, did i?you deserved every penny.please moira,i want you to considerthis offer as my amends.if you sign on them, we all getback to doing what we love.there is something i lovethat i haven't been ableto do for quite some time.(repeated slaps)(pained grunts)now, mr. bernstein,i have a few demands.(dog barks in the distance,car whooshes by)(noisy eating)hm. hm. mmm.i don't know, johnny,i have been racking my brainto come up with the cash.i mean at this point,i'm willing to sell my baseballsigned by geena davis.might take more than that,roland.gentlemen. hello.- stevie.- hello.well, apologies for callingsuch a late meetingbut i think you'll both agreewe're in a bit of a situation.and by "situation"he means that money-pitof a motel we bought.no, i stand by the decisionto expand our businessbut at this point,i think our only optionis to sell the second motel,and recoup whatever we can.yeah, and i'm in totalagreement.well, i don't like that idea.i don't like that ideaat all.what else you got,johnny?what if we bought30 more motels?right now.what am i looking at?these are all the roadsidemotels currently for sale.now bottom line,we're not gonna make moneyoff of two or three locations.we're only gonna start seeingthe real moneyat 20 or 30 locations.yeah, i'm with stevie,it's a lost cause.now this would bea bigger undertaking.and if we franchisedon a larger scale,yeah, the dividendswould be greater.stevie, where did youcome up with this?oh, it was in a booki was given.i don't know,maybe you read it.you did this before,mr. rose.i think you can do it again.well, we would need a properinvestor to pull this off.you know, for the first time,i think i can actually call insome favours with this idea.i mean, we'd need a reallystrong pitch.and boy, i-i don't even knowif anyone from the old lifewould even take a meeting but...a wise man once wrote:"you miss 100% of the tapesyou don't play".i did write that.and i know thata wise man once wrote:"thank you to my wife, moira."that's just the dedication,roland.that's as far as i got,johnny.i'm sorry, i'm partialto historical fiction.("sunrise bay" plays on tv)oh alexis, has our quarantinebeen lifted?yeah, i was scaredi was gonna get bed sores,so i'm going for a run.also, i needed to like cleansemy brain a bit.'cause eight hours of watching"sunrise bay"made me feel a littlenot-right in the head.it had that effect.the new england journalof medicinedid a fascinating study on it.will you be trapped in thiscrystal the entire episode?best to skip ahead.so how was the meeting?you alexis are one shrewdlittle reynard.you were right about clifton.he sucks in this, by the way.so he had you written offthe show?yes, but i usedthat little nugget- to negotiate a superior deal.- hm?i am after all,the one in the cast memberstill making headlines.so you still said yes?i did.but on the conditionthat clifton be written offthe show - death of my choosing.and i asked formore money.okay. yass, mom.and a diamond tennis bracelet.okay. well, that seems likea bit much.but it still sounds like yougot what you're worth?oh, god no.i made them an offerthey had to refuse.so, you're not doing it then?no.thank you, alexis.thank you for removingmy rosy lunettes,so that i might see cliftonfor who he really is.if you did all thatwithout getting out of bed,imagine what you're capableof doing.okay, how is itthat your daughteris also trapped in the cavebut has never looked up once.you've been hanging over herfor three straight episodes.oh, you know, children, thisis where the season picks up.when the cave starts talkingback to me.voiced by the wonderfulpeter falk.i was gonna gofor a run.shh.she's about to look up.sync corrections by srjanapala
