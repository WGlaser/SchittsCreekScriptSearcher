at this place,untouched from the 60s.these motels were a gold mine,roland,all they need is a littledusting.and bleach, lots of bleach.you know, there are boutiquehotelsthat would kill for this levelof authenticity.i'm thinking of turningthis placeinto the presidential suiteand charging a premium for it.i'm reminded john of shanghaiand our party secretary suitewith its own aquarium,i'd lay in a claw foot tubwatching the orcas.- joc.- and we're back.you know that staycationwe've been talking about?why don't we just do that here?well, roland, that-thatsounds good,but uh, that just can't happen.as a new business ownerit's dangerousto treat your assetsas personal possessions.that's my john.at rose video, he made mepurchase the blue-rayof my gritty feminist policedrama, "miranda rights".i rented that three times.miranda is so sassywhen she went undercoverfor that wet t-shirt contest.hey, the sooner we get thisplace guest ready,the sooner we can startmaking a profit.yeah. well,that sounds good

moral ground.are you sure this iswhat you want, david?this looks like someoneput a tarp overtheir living room furniture.yeah, i'm going for an englishestate in the offseason.okay, it's just uh,do you really want these photosto saymy relationship is an oldestate in the offseason?why don't i show youthe county fair backdrop,i think a ferris wheel wouldlook so cute on a mouse pad.i don't think we're gonna dothe mouse pads.- oh hi.- hi.- why do you look...?- hot?oh, i got a spray tan.patrick gave you hisappointment, didn't he?no, i just put mine on yourcredit card.okay, well that's fraudand you're

you said it, not me.um what, uh, what ha,what happened?did they use the allez vousbronzer on you?i don't know, david,they asked me what i wanted,i told them just to give mewhat you usually get.well,

more.i think this is probablyas good as it's gonna get- right now, ray.- okay, okay, okay.okay, here's whati'm thinking,we do that like threeto four more times,and then we go on a romanticwalk to your houseand we like hang out therefor a little bit.yeah um, that plan soundsreally active, alexis.- mhmm.- but uh my mom's stayingat my place and uh,i'd rather not walk in on herand her zumba instructor,don't wanna have to zoomback here.is everything okay?it's okay to admitthat i tuckered you out.no it's, it's not that.okay, then what is it?i just thought that it wasimportantthat we have this conversationin person.you're starting to sound likeme trying to end thingswith b-rock on the backstreetboys millennium tour.ted, you're not like tryingto break up with me, are you?no i'm not breaking upwith you.oh okay, thank god.so what is it?i got offered a job.you say that likeit's a bad thing.- is it a bad job?- no it's a great job,they wanna make me a permanentpart of the research teamin the galapagos.okay, define permanent.it's a three year contract.okay, that's a long time.yeah, i just,i keep waiting for thingsto get easier for us.so um, what are you gonnatell them?i, i don't

havea few days to talk about it,but then...yeah, no, the milk, i know.um, ted, i think i'm gonna needa minute.you know that i can't make bigdecisions under pressure,that's how i ended upwith a pixie

it's not like there'sa his sinkfor when the hersis inoperable.okay, moira.excuse me while i tryto pass through.oh john, these door frames,it's like tryingto force oneselfthrough the eye of a needle.i think uh, the point's beenmade, moira.oh, so you're willing toreconsider a room upgrade?- upgrade?- mhmm.oh, i thought you weretalking abouta romantic weekend.we start with a weekendand go from there.you don't believe we deservethis perquisite, john,at least until we securea way out of here.moira, yeah,the room is bigger,it might even be nicer,but haven't we managedto make due here in this roomover the past few years?yes, in the same way roadcrustations are knownto make due in old soda cans.and what about the kids?we're just goingto abandon them here?they're practicallymiddle-agedand they're not denyingtheirselves betterment,why should we?alright, maybe it is goodbusiness practiceto sample the productbefore selling.well, whatever you thinkis best, mr. rose.i've packed your weekender,it's in the car.see, these are good,we could use any of these.david, those are just oneswhere you look good.well...only took me nine showersto still look like this.see, this is good,this is
