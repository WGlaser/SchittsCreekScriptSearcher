schitt's creek - s03e11"stop saying lice"alexis, i just got anemail from your school.okay, in my defense,i did not know he wasa substitute teacher,and basically, nothing happened.okay, well, that's not it,and please don't godown that path again.apparently there's a liceoutbreak in your class.- oh my god!- ewww!ugh, it's probably kelsey,she's such a horse girl.honestly alexis, if you don'tlike the way somebody looks...


dad, that's so mean!she doesn't look like a horse,she just talks about them a lot.and smells a bit.you know, you keep scratching.ewww!no, i'm just allergicto the down pillow.no, no, you probably have lice.you're scratching because you have lice!wait a minute, we were in allthe rooms changing the sheets!okay, how-can lice jump?because if i was sleeping in my bed,could a lice jumpfrom her bed to my bed?can everyone stop saying lice please?!now i've gotta go back andchange all the sheets again.


okay, how do i know thatshe didn't give me her lice?david, you don't have lice.nobody here has lice!no, no, you do!you-you have the lice!- ah!- ughhh!- oh! aah!- alexis, you've gotta go to the storeand get something to deal with that now!okay, i've gotta go backand change all the sheets.oh! this is the last timei take a pity selfie with kelsey!- get away from me!- aah!-- corrected by chriske ---- sync has done by the_foe --housekeeping.- hello!- oh, hi.uh, just here for the complimentary...sheet change.but the bed's already made up.yes, yes, well some of our guests prefermorning and... evening sheets.uh, these are a little heavier,for sleeping, right?so if you don't mind,i'll just get to it.i think we're good, i mean,we haven't even touched the sheets.oh, good, good, good!why is that good?well, it just meansyou're having a busy day,you know, up and at 'em.- oh.- right.right.and your hair's in a ponytail,that's fantastic.yeah...and by that i meanit's very hot outside,and... gives the necka chance to breathe,um... yeah.so...we're actually just on our way out so...oh well, good timing then, huh?so why don't we follow you out, hmm?so that's a yes to changing the sheets?no, no, i think we're good. thanks.after you.oh, so leaving everything as is, then.yeah!hi, sorry i'm late,it's been a busy morning.how are you?i'm fine, thank you.it's nice to see you.hm! are you talking to me?i'm not used to thatah, level of kindness.yes, we haven't seeneach other in weeks,so i was just sayingit's nice to see you.i'm going to ignorethat passive aggression,and instead, lean in to the factthat we're both workingprofessionals now,and mama oprah wouldbe very proud of us.okay, that's one way to look at it.um, so you know what ithink would be super fun,if we hung out at your place tonight.- my place?- mhm.you've never been to my place.yeah exactly, you werejust saying that we haven'tbeen spending as much time together,and that it's been really bothering you.i don't remember saying that last part.yeah, so i was just thinking like,what about a late night hang,or like, a platonic sleepover?mm... what's on your head?hm? a hat.that i'm test driving for the store.i mean, what's happening under the hat?- the other side.- oh, i see.yeah um, that would be a shower cap.so this would have nothing to do with...the lice outbreak at the motel?your dad just called me.mhm, um...so i might be takingpreventative measures.i can't afford to have thestore infested with lice.i don't think it works that way,but just so we're clear,you were wanting tohave a platonic sleepoverat my place would havenothing to do with the factthat your sister has lice?yes, that is almost entirely correct.oh...good morning!who's gonna be the one to tell her?i'll handle this.have i been let go? should i leave?- no.- i won't make a scene.you still have threeand a half more years.but who's counting?moira, i know that town beautificationis kind of your thing,so i know you'll wanna know that um...we're gonna build a flower garden.and it gets better!i imagine it must.we're gonna name it after you.oh, and look at that right there,utter shock!now, i'm flattered beyond all reason,but i can't help but thinkthe money could bebetter spent elsewhere,making much neededimprovements to the roads,the streetlamps, the parks,the sidewalks, the traffic light...moira, i don't think youunderstand how rare it isfor somebody to have somethingnamed for them in this town!i mean, yeah, the wholetown is named after me,and bob over here, he's got his bench.bob's bench.and ronnie's got her rec center.it's an outdoor tennis court,and last year the net was stolen.well, she's kind ofunder selling it there,the rec center is a majorhook-up spot for the kids.- so is the bench.- right.as much as i would love to contributeto the population growth of this townby way of teen pregnancies,i must decline.honey, it's all about legacy!your name will forever be associatedwith this town's name!i don't think you're helping.i truly appreciate the gesture.well look, before you say no...- no.- right.this is a really big deal, moira.for us to be doing this for you.okay.alexis, i didn't thinkyou were coming in today.oh um, i hadn't planned to,but it was really buggingme that your cupboardswere so... disorganized.it's saturday.no, i know. um...but the other reason is thati bumped into one of our clients,and her dog has lice,and she's worried that she now has lice.who was it?umm...meredith? meredith!she's new-ish, youmight not remember her,just kind of like,mid-length, wavy hair.- does she want me to help her?- no.no, she is too embarrassed.and i was like... mere-dith,meredith, there's noreason to be embarrassed,you're still exceptionally attractive,it's just lice, just get the shampoo,and deal with it!yeah okay um... the thing is,that you can't actuallyget lice from dogs.it's a different kind of lice.okay, so what should she use?should she use the flea stuff, or...oh no, she's fine touse the lice shampoo,but it's really moreabout combing them out.- ewww!- on the upside,you could tell her that...they're only attracted to clean scalps,and she shouldn't be too embarrassed.also, i'm kind of a samuraiwhen it comes to a metal comb, so...okay, are you sure, becauseshe didn't want to um,she didn't wanna bug you on a weekend.bug me.i am sure.okay, i will tell her.um, you know that it's me, right?- yeah, caught on pretty quick.- okay, thank you.you're the sweetestlittle vet i've ever met.i don't know about little,because i'm benching 225 right now,so it's not reallysomething someone little...- aaah, ted!- okay, yep.okay,so if you wouldn't mind sortingthese body milks by size,that would be great.can you drink these?um, it's liquid moisturizer,for your body, so no,you can't drink them.did you ask if you can drink it, too?okay, it says body milk on the label!you know, i told david that the labelwas gonna be misleading,but he insisted.what was it you said?"anyone with a fiber of common sensewould know that it's not actually milk."what do we think body milk is,if not milk... for your body?!- exactly.- stevie, right?- yeah.- i'm patrick.- i've heard a lot about you.- none of it is true.oh well, anyone with a fiber ofcommon sense would know that.i like him.i like you.okay, is this how this is gonna go?because we have way toomuch work to do todayfor me to feel attacked by wayof an imbalanced social dynamic.are-are you wearing a shower cap?!alexis has lice,and i am taking preventative measures.by wearing one of our hatsthat we now can't sell.oh, he doesn't haveit, i checked his head.i think the shower cap ismore of a fashion choice- at this point.- uh huh.but you're living withsomebody who does have lice,so just 'cause you don't have it now,doesn't mean that youcouldn't get it tonight,or tomorrow, or whenever.it's almost as if youwant me to get the lice.i don't want you to get it,i just, i think you should be careful.you can crash at my placetonight if you need to.thank you.but stevie offeredher place this morning.- oh,- so...can i crash at your place?this is really fun for me.i'm having a lot of fun.i never thought i'd see the day, john.you've been domesticatedbeyond recognition.moira, it's been a bit of a day here.well, this might lift your spirits,i just came from council,and they want to name a garden after me.a garden?oh, that's flattering.another feather in your cap, huh?oh, i have enoughlegacies as it is, john.i've got that playhousetheater in pasadena,my titular scholarship with phoenix,david and alexis.yeah, but still, a garden is nice.you'd have to think twiceabout turning that down.oh, i've already turned it down.oh.okay.well, it's just...about a month ago i heard from thelucy albion studio theater in pasadena.i don't know what that is.it... used to be calledthe moira rose...no, no! don't say it!they've stripped theplayhouse of my name?who the (bleep) is lucy albion?!a volunteer usher who died last year.and when were you planningon telling me this, john?!well moira, it's notlike you haven't overreactedto bad news in the past.i just thought it mightsit better with youonce you'd heard about the garden.no, i just told you about the garden.uh-huh.john, did you ask roland and bobto name a garden after me?no, no!they wanted to name thegarden after you, moira.after i offered to pay for the plaque,and a good chunk of the upkeep.i don't believe this.sweetheart, i just thoughthaving your own garden in townwould make losing thetheater less painful!oh, i won't be pitied, john!or fed your pacifyingpablum like some kind of...soft-headed infant!well, i thought it was a nice gesture.oh no, no, now i just wonder what elseyou're keeping from me.nothing!- well, alexis has lice.- what?!ewwww!ewwwww!i assume you shaved her head!and we have to put a wig on her.but not one of my wigs!these have to be boxed now!moira, i've got it all taken care of.and i'd think twice about that garden.oh, it's too late, thenotion of that gardenis as abhorrent to meas our daughter's scalp!and i was worriedabout you overreacting.what are you doing in here?well, you said to change the sheets.no, we said not to change the sheets.oh, you said not to change the sheets!i could've sworn i heardyou say change the sheets.- well, while i'm here, i may as well...- please, just leave the bed.- sure.- what's going on?what's going on?well, my... okay.my daughter and i weresetting up the room earlier,and it turns out she has lice.i was changing the sheets because youknow, i didn't wanna take a chance.been there.yeah, our six year olddaughter had lice last year.- how old's yours?- 28.oh, and i checked yourhairbrush and it is fine.you checked my hairbrush?!it's a complimentary service.why didn't you justtell me that you had lice?ted, a bug literallyfell out of my head,onto my textbook this morning.it was so disgusting.plus i didn't want you to picture melike some well-toned bug woman.well, i've seen worse.fleas, ticks, worms.granted, all of thosewere on house pets.- ted!- i'm just saying,that you know, it could've been worse.i could be shearing youwith trimmers right now.you're really good at this.it reminds me of when i was in bangkok.there was this amazinglittle resto-loungethat specialized in tahitian food,and scalp massages.i'm not sure what's more disgusting,what i'm doing right now,or the concept for that restaurant.it was a resto-lounge.speaking of thailand,i think is probablythe most intimate thingi've ever done with an employee.speaking of thailand,i think we've done a few moreintimate things than this.i meant while they were an employee.not that i'd do this for anyone else.well, thank you.because it's actually pretty gross.you said it wasn't that bad.well, there are some big ones in here.- ewww!- i'm joking, i'm joking.oh, maybe not.- eww!- nope, it's fine.it is fine, it's fine.just-just the mama, we got her.hi, i can't thank youenough for inviting me.really you should bethanking yourself for that.this is a lot nicer than i expected.for some reason i picturedyou living underground.in like, a bomb shelter?yeah like, bomb shelter aspects.look at what you've done to this place!look at all this stuff!look at that... frame on thewall that you put there.look at that sarah mclachlan poster!don't be dissing sarah mclachlan.who's dissing sarah mclachlan?i followed lilith fair for two summers.so...uh oh!two toothbrushes? hello!no, you see, this is exactlywhy i shouldn'tve let youbully me into allowing you to stay here!do you require two toothbrushes?yes, i do.ahhh...so maybe i was seeingsomebody a while ago,and i forgot to throwout his toothbrush.i don't recall you ever telling meabout that chapter of your life.well, i'm sure i would've told you,if you weren't so busy with the store.i'm sorry, is that a soft,yet affirmative indicationthat you miss me?no, it is not.because i agree, our social predicamentis not ideal,but we are both thriving professionally,and i feel like thatneeds to be celebrated.speaking of, where are the drinks?- in this thing?- the fridge.- is this... okay.- just...okay, i just see twode-shelled hard-boiled eggsin a bag, should i be scared for you?the vodka's in the freezer.oh, in the freezer, okay.there she is!look at that, look at her, go.what a gift.- moira!- oh, hi.i just wanted to say congratulationsabout the garden.oh well, you're very kind,but i've declined the offer.- oh, really?- yes.as much as i love the spotlight,sometimes it's best to just step aside.that's surprising.i know when they told methat they were gonna put my nameon the new low-impactplay center at the school,i was thrilled!yes, it can be very excitingwhen the tributematches the contribution.my name graced a theater,a country club ladies' locker room,a roadway.a whole road?oh, not just any road.this was a lifesaving road,dedicated to emergency vehicles.like a fire route?technically it was referredto as evacuation route 14,but those of us in the knowaffectionately called it..."moira rose boulevard."you know, moira,having your name ona small, local gardenwouldn't take away fromany of those other amazing achievements.you might think,but this littleparticular little tributewas bought by my husband,in an attempt to assuage my ego!and that would be differentfrom the other times because...well, i mean, of course philanthropyand recognition alwaysgo hand in hand, but...listen.i know this isn't what you wanted,but i think it wouldmake johnny really happyto make you happy.i mean, take roland.every year he buys me coconut macaroons,and i just don't havethe heart to tell himi am really allergic to coconut.yeah, every valentine'sday i just rash right up.last year my throatalmost completely shut.i shouldn'tve eaten those eggs.i can't believe i'm trappedunder a blanket with youknowing you ate those eggs.i bet patrick's fridge is fully stocked.what does that mean?!it means he's got his life together.he's a pretty eligible bachelor.patrick.i suppose.what? he's my business partner.oh, aren't they all.what are you doing?what, you guys just seemto really get along well.yeah, because we'rein business together,and compliment eachother professionally.hm, but he offered for youto stay over at his place.yes, because unlike you and i,he's extremely generous,and has absolutely no ulterior motive.then why are you here and not there?because you asked me first.i didn't, though.and it would be weird.well, if nothing's goingon, why would it be weird?because we're in business together,and i don't know whathis preferences are.well, you're not gonna find outwhat his preferences areon a sleepover with me.well, i wouldn't besharing a bed with him,i'd be in some guest bedroom.guest bedroom, what is he, bill gates?yes, he's bill gates.i like this for you.like what? there's nothing to like.you seem flustered.i'm not flus...maybe it's the eggs.ughh!um, am i reading this right?"the moira's rose's garden."okay look, i went backand forth on the namea couple of times, and i may have...confused the engraver.the moira's rose's garden.so the garden is dedicatedto a rose that moira owns?i don't think that thereare enough apostrophes.i don't even see a rose in the garden.because there aren't any roses.or are we the roses?okay, i'm getting roses for the garden,i'm-i'm getting roses.oh... okay.and what are these numbers for?that's mom's birthday, david.those are the last four digitsof your father's credit card.it was a complicatedorder form, all right?there were a lot of fields to fill in.um, i hope you got areally good deal on this.it's by the letter, so he paid extrafor those apostrophe "s's."okay, enough, enough.this is still a very bighonor for your mother.is it not?- mhm...- yes?mhm.so when we die,are we all gonna be buried here?-- corrected by chriske --
