irie"bumper sticker.oh no, it's perfect!- hello!- moira!this car is $3,000 more than our budget.i'm a trained actor.a humble back storywill disabuse this manof any notion we're too patrician.well, okay, but...let's start by losingwords like "patrician."hey folks, how we doin' today?oh, excited beyond compare!yes, especially with thisbeing our first ever purchaseof an automobile.yes, it's our first car,let's hope we can afford it.yes, my poor 'usband,lost his job recentlyas a tennis pro,yes, at a public resort, that is, yeah.well, let's get youfolks settled inside,we'll see what we can do.oh, thank you.it'll be nice to get off the streets,and be indoors for a change, yeah?- moira...- what?!the truth is... that, um...we've-we've struggled with penuryfor quite some time now,well, just two years ago, we were...practically 'omeless.where are you two from?you know, i've beenwondering that myself.i'm from london,i was one of two identical twins.tragically, i was snatchedfrom my crib at birthby russian mobsters.mhmm, they looked at my fair skin,and my dazzling eyes, and they said,we'll make a pretty penny on that one,on the human black market, we will.- and what about the twin?- what's that, love?well, if you're identical,i thought you'd both be valuable.yes, wouldn't you?she wasn't born yet.yep, she wasn't born.'til three minutes later,and the bratva work very quickly.that is quite a story.isn't it?um, excuse me, i...i'll be back in a moment.i think he's buying it!you think?hey!these are for you.oh, you didn't have to do that.lisa dropped them off.- oh.- hey!- don't be embarrassed.- i'm not embarrassed.i know your little secret,and as your assistanti will be discreet,- and professional.- what?no one's gonna know that you're havingan adventurous little rendezvouswith an apple-cheeked farm-woman!but that's not what happened!wink.i was making a housecall to lisa's farm,and got...head-butted by her goat.is that when one of you is on the floor,and then the other onekind of just like hops...no, uh...i was head-butted by an actual goat.and as a vet, that's not somethingthat i want getting out,so please don't be thinkingthat this is something that it isn't.okay. sorry.those are delicious, by the way.she practically begged me to try one.so... i did.and i also took a couple for david.um, yeah, you're right,this is a bit depressing.are we sure this is the right place?she was very specificabout where she wanted to be scattered.um, so what are...where-how... where should we do...well, i don't wantpeople parking on her!- okay.- so...maybe i could just put heron the grass over there?sure.ooh, it smells like cigarettes.- ohhh...- um...do we scatter it all, or do we...- save some for later?- later?!i don't know!this is gonna be me.well, theoretically,it's gonna be all of us.um, although i'mhoping that when i pass,there'll be a little more fanfare.my great aunt worked at the motel.front desk.- you never told me that.- yep.so i just need to take up palm reading,get a few cats,move to saskatchewan.well, a girl could dream.you are not your aunt!from what i've heard, iwouldn't be friends with her,and i'm friends with you, sothat's one major difference.she made her decisions.and you're going to make yours,and they are going to be different.and they are going to be great.and if they're not,i'll be sure to scatteryour ashes in a much nicer parking lot.i think i'm just gonnastart pouring, okay?- okay, so...- okay. not here, though!let's go just... over there.thank you very much for waiting.- oh.- this is sarah,this is my wife, and business partner.oh hi, is everything okay?well, i hope you can forgive me,but... i couldn'thelp overhear your story.oh yes, love,it's an inspiration to many, i'm sure.and it sounded so familiar.but then i remembered..."sunrise bay!"my wife was addicted to your show!well, i find it's wonderful,but we don't have a television, so.- moira...- i remember when your twin showed up,and stabbed armand withher sharpened crutch.okay, look folks, i'm really sorry,my wife was simply...trying to fictionalizeour very real financial struggle.okay, that was fun.there's no need to be embarrassed.we read all about...what happened to you,- losing everything.- it's heartbreaking.- we didn't lose everything.- well...seeing you working so hard,just to shave a fewbucks off that lincoln,which... we could do.but now you're makingit sound like some...act of desperation, itwas simply just an act.um moira, they're justtrying to help us outby giving us a better price.well, nonsense, dear,we can certainly pay full freight.you save that discountfor someone who needs it!yes, okay. dear, look.we really would appreciateany financial assistance.or perhaps we mighthave to take our businessto a dealership thatsells brand new cars.as you can see, we can't even affordher meds right now.i'll get the paperwork started.here we go, dear, here's the chair.hey, so i'm headed out,and i will drop off the fleashampoo for ms. warner's cat.sorry, what did mrs. warner say?she called to ask if youwould drop off flea shampoo,and she also asked ifyou would wash her cat,but i said that you were too busy.oh. y-yeah. uh okay, you know what,- i got this.- i'm happy to do it.um... do we even have flea shampoo?uh, it's fine, i-i'll do it.it's best if i do it.no, it's on my way home,and i rarely offer todo things like this, so.heather warner doesn'tactually have a cat.ohhh.she like, thinks she has a cat?that's so sad.but i guess she is like50, so that makes sense.yep, she's 42.and she's not crazy.it's... code.i'm kind of seeing heather,and the flea shampoo is...a booty call?!well, i'm not crazyabout the term, but...ted, look at you, little sexy susan!okay, calling me "susan"kinda takes the sexy out of it.but i'm glad we wereable to deal with thisin a professional manner.ted, say hi to her cat for me.that's too far, alexis!to maureen budd,and not following tooclosely in her footsteps.so we're drinking to menot becoming an alcoholic?mhmm.off to a good start.hi, i'm looking for stevie budd.- i'm her.- hi, we spoke on the phone,i'm elaine, from west, read and healy.i have some personal effectsthat were willed to you,- oh...- and some documents for you to sign.thanks.oh my god.when did you have this photo taken?that's not me.that's maureen.mmm.okay, well, just because you beara vague physical resemblance,does not mean that you...will end up in an apartmentwith newspaper for curtains.okay, this is not going to be you.what is this?that is the deed to the motel.sorry?maureen budd owned the motel.you didn't tell me that.nobody told me that.i mean, i knew it was in the family,but i didn't know she outright owned it.was she of sound mind?uh well, according to her will,she wanted you to have it.was she of sound mind?!okay, this still doesn't meanthat you are going tobe anything like her!i mean sure, on the surface,it is a step in thatdirection, but, you know,um, okay, you know what?- let's clear some of this stuff.- yeah.starting with the urn.and i'm-we're gonna just...you look like a contestanton "the price is right."well, it worked, becausethe price was right.how much did you pay for this?david, it's not polite to askwhat you paid for something.it says $7,250 right there.well, that's way over budget!well, that's not what we paid for it.well, what did you pay for it?!$6,000 quid, love.- oh god!- thank you, moira.and it would've been a lot less,if your mother hadn'ttalked them back up!you can't put a price on dignity.uh, tell that to your outfit.this is your outfit.- what?!- okay, look.the important thingis, we now have a car!is this a car for dead people?no, it's not a hearse!look, this is a usedcar, so it's not perfect.were all the other cars on fire, then?it's
