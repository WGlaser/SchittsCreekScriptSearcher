- okay, if you think you'velived through a bad day,
try being our next guest.
- when she showed up to ascreening of her new film,
"the crows have eyes:the crowening--"
- (giggles) fun name!- it is!
the last thing she expectedwas an actual crow attack!
(crowd screams in terror)
hosts: (faux sympathy) oh...(chuckling)
- well, now we're being toldthat the whole thing
was a pr stuntput out by the movie.
now, is that clever or what?
- it sure is!we are so very lucky
to be joined this morningby moira rose.
well, ach!- ach!
- what a ride this has been!- yes.
- what a ride indeed, barb!
oh, let me first assureyour viewers
that not a single crowwas harmed,
and as for the humans,
oh, nothing but a littlewounded pride...
and one severed earlobe.
- oh! (laughs)- ouch! yeah!
- yes, everything you saw
was part of a carefullyorchestrated,
entirely deliberate stunt.
- oh, well, it seemsto have worked, moira.
with over more than2 million views
in less than 24 hours,
this video has created anincredible buzz for the movie,
which, as of right now,
is officially trendingon interflix.
- it is?!(laughs excitedly)
well, if you're sayingit's a smash hit,
then i'm just going to haveto take your word for it.
as well as the wordof millions of streamers
across the internet, i suppose.
you know, the brilliant thingabout being on streaming
is that one can startthe movie at any point,
any time they like.
- you know, moira,i think it's safe to say
you are officially backin the game!
(thumps desk)- yes!
- well, you heard it herefirst!
do not adjust your sets!
excuse me, but i'd be remiss
if i didn't acknowledgemy daughter, alexis rose.
this whole pr coup d'état neverwould've happened without her.
- honestly, we just had funwith it.
- can't hear you. (chuckles)
poor dear's not mic'd.
- well, looks like there'sno stopping you two now!
congratulations!- hm-hm.
both: thank you!alexis: (giggles)

(door opens)
- gentlemen. morning.
i believe you've metmy roommate, bob.
- roommate?- mm-hmm.
- (chuckle sheepishly) yeah.uh, ronnie's been nice enough
to let me stay in herguest room,
ever since gwen...
took the house.
- yeah. and as much as i'menjoying the slumber party,
i really think that bob coulduse a change of scenery.
maybe he could crash herefor a night...
or six?
- uh, yeah...- i don't think we, uh,
we have any clean roomsavailable.
- oh, i... i don't minda dirty room.
i hope that doesn't soundas sad as...
as it feels.
- bob, why,why don't you take a seat?
and grab some waterwhile you're at it,
'cause you should reallyhydrate after all that crying.
- gwen used to love water.
(sobbing)
- okay, i feel badly for bob,
but it's not a good look
to have him wallowingaround here.
roland: well, where do youwant the guy to wallow?
i mean, johnny,there's plenty of sad people
staying at this motel.
- that's not exactly how i'ddescribe our guests, roland.
- well, i'm just saying,maybe he could meet
a fellow wallower here?
- oh, it'd be really niceif bob could meet somebody
'cause from what i hear,
gwen isn't exactly sittingat home.
- or, what if...
we take bob out for the evening
and kind of act as his wingmen
- johnny, you know,the whole dating scene
has kind of changed a littlesince you were single.
(clears throat) first off,we now have electricity.
(laughs)- (laughing)
- okay, all right,are you in or not?
- ooh, i'm in. 'cause i don'twanna miss a chance
to see how this plays out.

uh, lucky gwen,
she has another one of hermale cousins visiting.
(chuckles then sobs)
david: this coffee's delicious.- thank you.

but, it's all good.
we'll be getting our dormsback in...
better shape than we left 'em.
- can't wait.- let's talk about you!
everyone here has been watchingyour video!
and to think it was all fake?
- totally fake.isn't that wild?
and all of these pr agenciesfrom new york are calling
to ask me how i did it.
- how did you do it?
- um, it's like a little bittoo complicated
to explain over this.- hi, theodore!
gorgeous view!
- hi, mrs. rose!congrats on the movie!
that last scene where youleap from your nest
only to discover thatyour wings
aren't developed enough yet...- oh, you're too kind.
the daily mail called ita "flap for the ages!"
- okay, can i have my boyfriendback now, please?
- hm.(phone rings)
- (clears her throat)oh!
it's buzzfeed callingabout the 10 goriest
clara mandrake accidentsfrom the film.
- best we take it.
and don't forget,we have a conference call
with the interflix pr peoplein a tight 15.
- okay.- wow,
it seems like you've gota lot going on, alexis.
- yes, but not too muchfor you.
- no, don't worry about me,
you're obviously in highdemand.
- alexis! they're askingabout co-stars.
i can't be expected to remembereveryone i meet!
- mm. okay, okay.well, i guess i do have to go,
but i will see youin a few days
and i can't wait!
- i can't wait either.moira: (shouting) alexis!
- okay, i'm coming. ugh!
okay, love you! (blows kiss)- love you--
(button clicks)ooh!
(birds chirp, door opens)
- i don't think we're the samesize, johnny.
i might have a trouble fittingtissues into these pockets.
- oh, you won't need tissues.
there'll be no crying tonight,bob.
you look like a million bucks.
roland: well, actually, bob,in johnny's suit there,
you look like a guywho had a million bucks,
but then lost it. (laughs)
- very funny, roland.
now, the suit works, bob.
ronnie: bob, in my experience,
it doesn't matterwhat you wear.
it's all about being yourself.
- i think the last person
bob wants to be right nowis himself.
- i agree with roland.
- i don't know if i can speakon behalf of women here--
- you can't.
- moira used to say,when she was single,
she would always be attractedto men
who could make her laugh.
- how'd she end up with you?
- (laughs)
- all right, why don't we trya little test run here.
let's imagine we're in a bar.
ronnie, do you wanna be thewoman in this little scenario?
- not a chance.- okay. (clears throat) mm!
move over. i... (clears throat)will be the woman.
- okay. so we're in a bar
and, uh, you see this veryintriguing looking gentleman.
- okay. (clears throat)
(high voice)hello, i'm...
i'm gwen.- oh...
- you had to pick gwen?- i'm sorry,
i saw bob standing there
and that was the first namei thought of.
they're always together.- okay. hold it together.
- pick another name!- okay, all right.
uh... okay, yeah.
hi. i'm ronnie.
that's my friend gwen.- oh...
- okay, this is a disaster.
- thank you, roland.i'll take over from here.
bob, honestly,- (crying)
- you know,just a few runs and...
you're gonna be drowningin phone numbers.
- no. no... (sobbing)
i... i can't breathe.
- ooh.
- you know what? jake dida great job with this.
- mm-hmm.i was just about to say
this coffee table reallybrings out your lips.
- okay, what? i can'tcompliment the guy?
he's talented. you know, he'slike a, a one-man operation.
- not in my experience.
- and i think it wasvery nice of him
to invite us for drinks tonight.
- wasn't it?- yes, it was. it was very nice
and i think that we shouldget back to him about it.
- about going to his placefor "a whiskey or whatever"?
- david, i'm fine to havedrinks
with one of your exes, okay?- okay, first of all,
jake is nobody's exand everybody's ex.
and second of all,going to jake's for a drink
is never just goingto jake's for a drink.
- oh... oh. so you...
okay, so you think he invitedus over to... to...?
- yes, i do. yeah.- yeah.
well, in that case,we definitely shouldn't go.
'cause we're not reallythe kind of couple that...
- mm-hmm.- yeah...
- that being said,
if we ever did decide to...
have "a whiskey" with someone,
jake would be the personto do that with
because he literally doesn'tcare about anything.
so just...
i'm just throwing it out there.
- i mean, we always havethe option of going
and just having a whiskey.
- okay. and i always havethe option of online shopping
and just putting thingsin the cart.
that's not gonna happen.
- um... what's all this?
- they just keep coming.
- well, congratulations.
that must mean everyone'shappy.
- oh, very happy, yes.
thanks to your little attackof the corvidae,
we are interflix's number onestream of the day.
tied only with the fourthseason
of "caroline in the city."
- from interflix.
"to alexis,
congratulations and thank you.
the competition is eatingcrow." (chuckles)
"love, your new best friendsat interflix."
- they're all for you.
not those - those are fromjoyce dewitt.
i didn't want to overwhelm you,dear,
i know you're being pulledin another direction.
though, you might find a bitmore delectation in this.
- no, i do. i... i just likehaven't received flowers
from someone i wasn't...friends with.
(exhales sharply)
what do i do?
- what do you want to do?
- i can't leave now.
- if you're worriedabout the flowers,
they'll likely be deadin a week.
- yeah, like my careerif i walk away
with everything that'sgoing on.
i've already made ted waitan extra month.
i can't... back out now.
- so you...you weigh your options.
on the one hand,you are perched
on the precipiceof a dream come true
and you can jump knowing,possibly for the first time,
that you can succeedat anything
to which you put your mind.
- and on the other hand?
- what other hand?- ted!
- (gasps) dear ted.
yes, this is a quandary.
- (sighs heavily)
(low hum of chatter,pool balls clack)
- well, things seem to begoing well.
- yeah, look, they're standingpretty close together.
that must be a good sign.
- yeah, and he's not crossinghis arms.
that's good body language.and... they're hugging!
- uh-huh.
- and... now he's walking away.okay.
- well? how'd it go, bob?
it looked like you twowere hitting off.
- what're the odds of...
running into my marriagecounselor here?
- i'm sorry, did you just say
you picked up your marriagecounselor?
- no.
i'm saying she told meshe can't keep seeing me.
apparently, there's a conflictof interest
and, uh, she's chosen to gowith gwen.
but... i can't blame her.
- okay,
can we try my system now?
we all laugh,on the count of three,
as if bob just tolda very funny joke.
- oh, no pressure.
- well, you don't actuallyhave to tell a joke, bob.
just act like you did.
and that might attract uh...you know, someone's attention.
- what if they ask mewhat i said?
- well, they're not gonna askyou what you said.
- i don't know, johnny.
this sounds like a reallycomplicated plan.
- mm-hmm.- it couldn't be more simple.
just follow my lead.
(laughing)
all: (laughing)
- it's working.it's working. working.
- is something funny?
- well, now that youmention it--
- because it looked like youwere laughing at me.
roland: (snorts,stifles laughter poorly)
- no, it's, it's just my veryavailable friend, bob here,
just said something so funny.
- what'd you say?- you said they wouldn't ask.
ronnie: okay, i'm not sayingi'm bailing on this,
but... i think i'm gonna gomingle and...
i might not come back.
- it's not so much, uh,what he said,
it was just, uh, it was a funnyobservation. (laughs)
- well, next time,observe someone else.
- (makes engine noise)
crrrash and burn, johnny.
- boy, i... i buckledunder the pressure.
but she was a dead ringerfor gwen.
(jacket rustles)
- oh, didn't know we werebringing our friends tonight.
- 'kay, i knew i shouldn't haveworn this shirt.
- no, it's nice, it's nice.is it new?
and does it come inan adult size?
- it's not new.i just haven't worn it yet.
- so it is new then.- is that cologne i smell?
- no. this is a leather-scentedbody moisturizer.
- so, you... you moisturizedyour body then.
you know what? (chuckles)why don't we not do this?
this is getting a bitcomplicated.
- the only thing that'scomplicated here
is the length of your sleeves.
go long, go short.just pick one.
um, as for this?if one of us wants to leave
and the other one wantsto stay, then...
- we both leave.- we... both leave, yeah.
so... i think you should knockon the door
because these arms are niceand warmed up.
- all right.(knocking)
(door opens)- hi, boys.
so glad you could make it.come on in.
(low hum of chatter and music)
- oh wow.
a lot of people are herefor drinks, david.
- yeah, a few more are ontheir way.
make yourselves at home, boys.
great shirt, by the way.- aw.
- mm-hmm. thanks.
um...
we left our wine in the car.- oh.
- so we should go get that.
- oh, don't worry about it.plenty of vino here.
- yeah, it's just that oursis um...
kosher.- mm.
- well, hurry back. we're gonnastart the massage circle soon.
- oh...- don't wanna miss it.
- think you're upfor the massage circle?
- this is way too many people.- yeah.

and... stevie?
oh... my god.
- huh.
- what're you doing here?
- what're you two doing here?- we were...
- we were just...- invited for drinks?
- i don't know whatyou're talking about.
we came here to say hi
and now we're leaving.- mm-hmm.
- can i not have one thingfor myself?
- no. anyway, we're gonna go.

so i think i'm gonna finish ithere, and then...
meet you guys later?
- no, you won't.- no, i won't.
- okay.- have fun.
- bye.
(crickets chirp)
(skype call rings)
ted: (out of breath)hey, sorry i'm late.
myrtle was laying her eggs
and the whole teamwas really excited.
- mmm! yeah, i bet.fresh omelettes.
- well, myrtle's a green seaturtle,
and they only spawnevery two years,
so eating her eggs wouldactually disrupt
an entire ecosystem.
plus, there's like a tonof cholesterol.
- mm. um, well, it soundslike you're super busy,
so i don't wanna take uptoo much of your time,
um, but i actually wantedto talk to you about something.
- i know what you're goingto say, alexis.
- you do?- i've been dropping the ball
when it comes to our phonedates.
between juggling workand, and the time difference--
- no, ted, you haven't doneanything wrong.
we've both been so busywith work,
and then on top of all of that,you've been...
renovating your entireapartment for me.
- well, i put some screenson the windows.
i wouldn't really call ita renovation.
- okay, well, you boughta juicer. (chuckles)
um, but the morei've been thinking about it,
the more i feel... like...
- i think you should staywhere you are.- maybe i should stay here.
- sorry, did, did you saysomething?
- no. um... what did you say?
- i can't have you come here,alexis. you'll hate it.
and i'm not just saying thatbecause the screens thati installed
are actually attractingmore bugs somehow.
but you'd be leaving everythingthat you're doing to come here,
and... i can't guarantee thatthere won't have another trip
that takes me awayfor days at a time.
d-don't get me wrong,i want you here so bad,
but i know you.
and no matter how many juicersi buy,
this place just won't feellike home.
sorry. i can't tellif the screen's frozen,
or if you're just reallyshocked.
but if you still want to come,i'm not gonna tell you not to.
- no, no, no, no. um...
you've made some very validpoints.
- yeah. i didn't even tell you
about the shared bathroomsituation.
- okay, well... maybe youcould've led with that.
would've saved us some time.
um, but i guess we justwait it out?
seems like our only option.
- yeah, until somebody inventsteleportation.
- (chuckles)
okay, well, um...nobody's home,
so why don't we startby teleporting you
out of that shirt?
- that's not really howteleportation works,
but i think that i can--
(gasps) aww... not again!
i'm so sorry, uh,but the ants are back
and, uh, i thinkwhat we're about to do
probably wouldn't end very wellif a fire ant was involved.
um, rain check?
- rain check.
- (sighs) i love you!(button clicks)
- uh, mm, oh!
love you.
(motorcycle rumbles)
- hey, i'm heading out.
- calling it a night?
- well, actually, my nightis just beginning.
- whoa... welcome tothe players' club.
- no, i'm not high-fiving that.
look, her name is vanessa,
and she has a very single,
very attractive friendover there,
who was just telling me about
all the trouble she's havingwith her car.
- bob, this is right upyour alley.
nobody knows their way aroundcars like you.
- yeah, i, uh, was reallyhoping to not talk shop.
- bob, just go overand talk to her.
- look, be yourself.
have a mint.go, go, go, go.
and that, gentlemen,
is how it's done. bye!
- you know, roland,i do not miss being single.
- whoa, here's to that.(bottles clink)
cheers, my friend.
- not that i didn't have funin my day.
they actually used to call me"the closer."
- yeah. (chuckles)well, that was probably
because women used to close outtheir tabs and go home
when you came into the bar.
- all right, speaking ofclosing out tabs,
i think we should get outof here.
- which is what the women usedto say to each other
when they saw you walkingthrough the door.
- i'm not setting you upanymore, roland.
- which is that whatyour matchmaker said!
(laughing)- oh boy...
it turns out,herbert linger,
the great fruit vintner isa rabid fan of the crows movie.
good luck findingsomeone who isn't.
we would loveto make our moira rosé,
an exclusiveand limited release.
well, hello! who is she and howdo we get a mouth full of her?
