anticipationabout something.christmas, birthdays,the ides of march.and now it seemsyour impending nuptialshas opened the floodgates.oh!why am i oddly flattered?i can't imagine.hmm.well, i hate to pointthis out, mr. rose,but if you weren't in sucha rush to see this place,we wouldn't be at a funeral.no, it's what happenswhen you leave anythingup to roland.we just have to find a windowwhere we can leavewithout anybody seeing us.because the last thing we wantto do is offend the womanthat's selling us this place.well, assumingwe're actually buying it.you know what they say,you can tell the qualityof a motelby the food they serveat the owner's funeral.we're not even supposedto be here, roland,can you put the plate...is that egg salad?johnny, is it?- yes, yes, it is.- mrs. terkstra,this is johnny rose.i-i'm sorry,i don't believe we've met.um, how did you know my benny?johnny...yes well, we were uh,friends, i mean...acquaintances,i would say...- from the bowling league.- uh, you mean curling?did-did you curl with my benny?i-you know, more important,i think we just wantedto come by- and pay our respects.- mm-hmm.because this must beso difficult for youdealing with your loss,and uh... selling the motel.i'm sorry, i'm still tryingto place you.i-i don't remember seeing youat benny's last bonspiel.well, that's becausejohnny here um...had another bonspiel to go to,and unfortunately that bonspielwas way more importantthan benny's bonspiel, so we...well, ro-roland that...- we had to go to that bonspiel.- no, no, no,- that was i would've been...- i think i know why you're here.it might be more appropriateto have this conversationoutside.since i wasn't in the curlingleague, can i go home?no. no.say havarti, girls!oh no!well, you can't win them all.wow, someone'sin a surprisingly good mood,considering they're15 minutes late.- blame my new internet frands.- what'd she just say?oh, i was dragooned intotaking over the interflixsocial media channels today,and apparently i'm quiteproficient at it.i thought you hatedsocial media.what did you call it, a um,a cauldron of self-absorption.you have an almost unsettingmemory, twyla.now just a quick snapfor my friend,"wine and cat gal 74,"and her frandsat the rehabilitation facility.fine, but nothing gets postedwithout my written approval.oh alexis, wonderful!i was just about to post.will you please do a selfieof me, and my jazzigals?um, actually, may i speakwith you for a moment?if interflix is askingif i'll extend my takeover,my answer is,i'll think about it.mm, actually,i think we might wanna discussthis matter privately.okay, two minutes, gals?in the meantime,if you'd like to followthe interflix channels...oh no, that won't benecessary.okay, who taught you howto livestream?!a wonderful teen namedcherrybus,she lives in singapore.why? who wants to know?okay, well, did she teach youhow to turn it off?because you just postedyour entire conversationwith david and patrick!no, i distinctly rememberputting down the phone.but you didn't stoprecording.so people basically got like,a whole podcastabout how david's wettingthe bed again.if i wasn't your publicist,i would be enjoyingthe situation a lot morethan i am.which is still like,quite a lot.oh, dear.fortunately, david doesn'tsubscribe to social media,so we-we just needto take it down,and david will be nonethe wiser.- okay.- hey moira,you weren't lying!you do havea knack for this.what are we looking at?okay, um, no needto watch that.okay, twyla, if you haven'tseen it already,then maybe just once,but that is it!now, i-i'd like to startfrom the beginning.mrs. terkstra,we-we were just...- i was speaking.- yes, you were.it's becoming very clearthat you peopledidn't knowmy husband at all.well now,when you say "know" uh...- am i still talking?!- yes, you were, ma'am.i can't say i wasn'texpecting you,i just didn't think you'dshow up at the funeral!i'm aware that my husbandwas not perfect.i told him that poker ringwas risky,and i know there were someshady business dealingsthat went on behindclosed doors,but i had nothingto do with it!i'm sorry?well, you're the federalagents i was warned about.no need to keep upthe act.her face has "fed" writtenall over it.thanks...mrs. terkstra,we're not feds.no, there seems to have beensome crossed wires here.no, we thought we were comingout to look at the property.we're fromrosebud motel.maureen bud's old place?that would be the one.uh, aunt maureen is...was my aunt.oh, for heaven's sakes!benny and i used to play bingowith maureen.what a small world!johnny and i used to playbingo with maureen,right after curling.roland.well, it would be a reliefto sell this placeto someonewe know.uh, well,we're not sure yet.but we can touch baseagain next week,and again, you have ourdeepest condolences.well, now that you're here,why don't you come on in,- and pay your respects to benny?- oh...considering you may be takingover his home.yes, yes, yes.well, sure.we can come in,and pay our respects.too bad it's notan open casket.i would've loved to say goodbyeto old benny's face.we'd be happy to open itfor you.no, no, closed-closedis fine.you sure?oh look alexis,patrick's here.yep, you asked meto meet you here.hmm.so what-what-what's goin' on?and david is bewitchinghimself elsewhere?yeah, he is uh,dusting the shelves,even though i cleaned themlast week,but hey, whatever it takesto get him through this.priority number one,get david through this!mhmm, mhmm!quick "q," um,has david taken your phone,or anything,or like, lookedat anyone else's phone?no.sorry, somebody wanna tell mewhat's goin' on?okay, okay...so, no biggie,but my mom may haveaccidentally postedyour little conversationfrom this morningover social media.the-the one about...the oopsie-daisy.yes.but don't worry,i am involved now,and i will be taking it down.it's still up?!and generating a lotof traction.but yes, it's been uh,we're taking it...it's being taken downright now.so how...how did this happen?right. i was strong-armedinto participatingin social marketing,and a dear friend of minefrom singapore,miss cherrybus,suggested i try my hand atcreating a living stream.okay, she doesn't knowwhat she's doing,and didn't know thatit was recording.okay look,david can never,ever find out about this.i am actually afraid thathe will never sleep again.precisely why we're involvingyou in this covert stratagem.so all we need to do is keepdavid off the internetfor like, 24 hours,or until a celebrity sayssomething wrong,which could be any minute.okay, i think i canhandle that.wonderful!crisis averted. hmm!yeah, so you still haven'ttaken the post down.- i'm doing that now.- cool.so i'll just sit hereuntil that happens.- it's kind of cute, though.- alexis.yes.- let's take it down.- mhmm.oh stevie,listen, i owe youan apology for today.you know, the way i rushed youinto that thing.on the plus side, we did makethat personal
