announcer: two ballsand two strikes on hernandez.
[bat cracks] and there's a well-placed bunt!
- why did he hit the balllike that?
- so that is called a bunt.it's uh, it's tactical.
it allows the guy on firstto get over to second.
- okay. who came up withthe word "bunt"?
sounds like something you'dneed to see a surgeon for.
- david, this is an importantgame.
you told me you could getinto this.
- i was referring to the pizza.
but, also, the game.
- [gasps] what do we have here?
i seem to have stumbledinto some sort
of gentlemen's cavern.
- hey, thanks for letting mestay here tonight, mrs. rose,
when david told mehe wanted to install
a japanese toilet at my place,
he neglected to mention thatit would involve
taking out a wall.- it was in the email.
also, you will be thanking mewhen you experience the heated,
motion-sensor toilet seat.
- so, david, i take it you'llbe employed as cheerleader
for whatever televisedsporting event
is unfolding for the remainderof the day?
- alas, this is patrick's day.we're doing what patrick wants.
- yes!- wow,
someone's enjoying their day!- [chuckles]
- sorry. just... clearedthe bases.
- it turns out herb ertlinger,the great fruit vintner,
is rabid fan of the crowsmovie -
good luck finding someonewho isn't -
and he would like to namea wine after me.
- oh my...- they should call it a...
a moira rosé.[chuckles]
- yes, that's what he hasin mind.
- amazing! congrats, mrs. rose!
- [faux excitement] mm.what news!
- yes, but he wants meto sample
the fruits of his labourthis very day!

- [sighs] well, unfortunately,
i told my fiancé i'd watchthe game with him--

- well, no, i haven't told him.
i mean, i haven't exactlysaid it out loud.
- yeah... i don't know, johnny.
not having the big father/son-in-law chat
feels like a missed opportunityto lay down some laws.
maybe patrick should get "thetalk" from old uncle roland.
- 'kay, nobody's having a talkwith uncle roland.
look, everything is fine.
if i feel like having a talk,i'll have a talk.
now, if you'll excuse me,
i have a few thingsto attend to.
- i remember when jocelyn's dadgave me the talk.
i mean, he was trying to talkme out of getting married,
but she was 9 months pregnantat the time,
so he really didn't have a legto stand on.
but i'll tell you,

[catching their breath]
yeah. um, hey! citrus?
- yeah?
- well, first of all, so greatto finally experience
what we're marketing.
- well, i'm glad youenjoyed it, alexis.

i think it'd be reallyhelpful to just like...
clarify some of the languagethat we're using.
- okay. like what?
- well, first of all,
i noticed that you referred to,um, like "demons" a lot.
- well, we all have demons!- yes, and i get that.
carbs. am i right?both: [laugh]

okay. i guess i'm just askingfor the people
signing up right now, um,
or is it like an actualgateway?
- oh! it's, it's a symbol.
- okay, good.both: [laugh]
- but it's also a literalgateway into the sky.

jocelyn: i'm just signing up.i can't...

i'm just gonna go and destroythis right now,
because i get the creepingsuspicion
that this place is like,not okay.
like i feel like this is morethan just a fitness class.
- what do you think it is?- um, i think it's a cult.
and like not the good kind.
not like when you goto india to follow
a long-haired, sexy man aroundfor a couple months
and then come home witha bangin' yoga body.
- yeah, if only someone hadpointed out how weird this was
from the beginning.
- alexis, can i still go onthe trip?
i'm not saying that i need it.
it's just last weekendi snuck roland jr.
into the ball room at ikea,
just so i could eat a meatballby myself.
- no. no. no one is going onthe trip.
and i am so sorry for makingyou guys sign up for this.
- well, i'm keepingthe hydration bottles.
i can just dump outthe crystal water.
- just a heads up, you guys,they're almost sold out
of the "nocturnal affirmation"cassette tapes, so--
- twy...- now i just need to buy
one of their cassette players.because you have to make sure
they're playing at the rightspeed when you're sleeping.
- twy, this is a cult.i brought you to a cult.
- oh my gosh,did you not know that?
my mom tried to take meto the gateway
for spring break one year.
i just thought i was supportingyour career.
- ugh, how did i fall for this?
cults prey on sad, weak,vulnerable people.
- i'll try not to takethat personally.
- i've just been so desperateto like throw myself into work,
and i clearly missed allthe signs
and now i've like endangeredall of us.
- well, there's an exit signright there.
- yup, but the arrow's pointingstraight up.

- yes. make us a nicemoira-lot...
or a moira rose-ling.
hey, not to be too effusive,but i'd call that one potable.
- i have had worst thingsin my mouth. [chuckles]
- i'm so happy that i wrestledyou away today
for this oenological escapade.
i finally have you allto myself, david.
when's the last time you and ihad a whole day together
with nary a care in the world?
- i mean, i am in the middle ofplanning a wedding,
while also buildinga successful retail empire.
- yes, you are.
then grant me this preciousmoment -
before there's a ringon your finger -
to say chin chin to youand your husband-to-be.
- this feels remarkablyselfless.
- you and patrick are twogood grapes.
- hmm...
- different notes,different tannins,
but... together, you've managedto make one perfect blend.
- thank you.- that being said--
- oh my god.- if i may impart a...
slice of marital sagacity:
you and i,
we're two potent grapes.
you know, there's a lot ofyour father in patrick.
- don't need that.
- but just because their notesare subtle
doesn't mean they requireany less attention.
- says the woman who literallyconvinced me
to leave my partner aloneat home,
watching a baseball game.
- you know i'm right.
your father and i have producedbeautiful wine together
for over forty years.- ew.
- and i have absolutelyno doubt
that your relationshipwith patrick
is going to get even betterwith age.
[door opens]
- okay, i hope we've landed onsomething,
because all i have leftis this cherry ice wine
[sniffs]and i think it might be corked.
- nope. my david has puttogether
a delicious blend right here.- mm-hmm-hmm!
- ugh. no. that's not the onewe picked.
- huh?- that's not the one we picked.
- what? well, let's retraceour steps.
- no.
- how many combinationscan there be?
[slurps]- no.
announcer: we'll be back tothe ball game right after--
- yeah, i guess i don't needto turn the volume down
for these commercial breaks.- oh, whatever works for you.
[chuckles][turns volume off]
- it's just i thought youhad something
that you wanted to talk about?
- oh, no, just wonderingwhat the inflation was
on concessions these days,
'cause it's been yearssince i've been to a ball game.
[chuckles]- well, it's highway robbery.
- yeah, you got that right.[chuckles]
- it just sorta seemed like youwanted to talk about david
for a second.
felt like that's whereyou were goin'.
- no, i...
sure. yeah, i can talk aboutdavid.
yeah, my son...
[clears throat]
who, uh, you will be...
walking down the aislewith very soon.
well, technically, you won't bewalking with him...
down the aisle, but...but um...
- mr. rose, i don't wannacut you off,
but um...
[clears throat]
i'm glad we have a minuteto talk.
because i, i hope it goeswithout saying that,
as lucky as i feelto have met david,
i also feel incredibly luckyto be joining your family.
- huh.
- i love your son
and i will always do everythingi can
to respect him
and to protect himfrom all of the things in life
that can set him off.
and there are many, many thingsthat can set him off--
- [laughs] oh, i'm aware, yeah.
um... oh boy, that...
pretty much covers it.
uh, i was only gonna saythat i...
i hope you treat him with...respect,
which you just said you would,
and, of course...i already knew it.
- i'm glad we had this talk,mr. rose.
- me too. me too.

like when people say herbor erb?

i wonder if that means they'llgive you priority boarding
when you enter the gateway?- oh my god,
stevie did this, didn't she?
- now, do the step machinesactually lift off the ground,
or are the step machines justthere to help you practice
for when you walk ontothe spaceship?
- come on, david,she didn't know.
- thank you!- but now that you do,
does it just make the journeyto the gateway
that much more meaningful?- okay, you know what?
honestly, this whole situationis starting to gross me out.
it's like i'm sharing a roomwith my twin brothers who kiss.
- mm!- mm...
[knock at the door]- well, look at this!
