hey ronnie, i needthe combination to the safe.it's your safe. youhave the combination.okay, then i need thenumber of a locksmith.i used a guy this weekend.yeah, gwen locked me out.by accident.roland, why do you need the safe?i've just been to the baby doctor,and i have some top secret informationabout whether it's a boy or a girl.joce and i wanna keep it a surprise.


your wife's pregnant in her 40's.how many surprises do you need?uh, it's kind of a schittfamily tradition there, ronnie.okay, i guess i justgotta crack this myself.it's either my birthday,or gloria estefan's.- mucho dias, mes amis.- morning!anyway, moral of thestory, i got a new keychain,and i keep a sleeping bag in the car.okay, turns out it'sgloria's, september 1, 57.who put a picture of a ghost on my desk?- i can't believe you opened that!- it was on my desk.that's the sonogram of our baby!i've been tryin' not to look at it.we don't wanna know what we're having.


roland, you couldn't possibly discern...oh no, it tells you here at the bottom.- don't say a word.- that's not fair!roland, why should i bethe only one encumberedwith this emotional cargo?oh, ronnie, ronnie,might you and i confabulatefor a moment in the back room?no, moira, i'm not falling for that one.no, i assure you.i assure you it's a salaciousbit of council-related news.oh.robert?thank you.okay, i'm gonna say it, we'vebeen open for 3 hours now,and not a single customer'swalked through that door.well, i mean, i heard thatthere was a storm warning- for today, so.- oh.how do you explain yesterday?maybe the storm warningwas for yesterday.so then how do you explain today?okay, i don't have all the answers.um, have we checked to seeif the door is unlocked?i think that we need tobe a little more proactiveabout this. we can't justwait for people to come in.we have to find better waysto engage with the community.or, hey, just like a way.just one way to engagewith the community.well, there's someone...that... is going to the café.you know why peopleare always in the café?because they feel at home there,it feels like... comfortable.okay, are you saying that idon't make people feel at home?um...okay.you remember our opening day here?yes! it was openingday, and there was booze.- and people are drunks.- yes but they still showed up.we need to do somethingto make this storefeel a little bit more accessible,a little bit more inclusive.okay. well, i am open to suggestions.what if we hosted an open mic night?i am open to suggestions.i actually used tohost one in high school.there was a little caféaround the corner from my house,it had a little stage in the back.drew a pretty big crowd.okay.so there was a point at which you,and some of your fellowamateur singer songwriterswould gather andperform poetry and songs?- yeah.- for one another?- mhm. that's right.- oh god.the occasional improvetroupe would stop by.i'm um... i'm feeling kind of ill.david, you can laugh now,but... an open mic night can bea surprising amount of fun.worst case scenario, we getsome people in the store.okay, no, worst casescenario, i watch improv.okay, so first of all, iwould like to thank you bothfor meeting with me today.was this really necessary?that's a good question,and the answer is, yes.um, i'm just gonna say it.this place needs a tonneof work, like top to tail.we're talking serious,but manageable, fixes.i think what you mean tosay is proposed improvements?no, i mean like full-blownthings that need fixing.oh.um, the comment cards, for example,it's become very clear tome that you don't read them.they're just a placebo effectfor people who feelthe need to complain.uh, you have to take thosewith a grain of salt, honey.those cards are writtenby embittered peoplewith way too much time on their hands.a lot of these are from mom.um, but some of them are from peoplewho are trying to point out things like,you don't even have a website.- we have a website.- no. i looked it up,and it's just like a cartoonof a construction workerholding a sign that says"we'll be right back". so.it's under construction.and the phone bookingsystem works just fine.um, actually the phonebooking system is confusing,and the woman's voice wasaggressive and off-putting.- i had strep at the time.- okay.i'm gonna offer you both apr and marketing strategy,pro bono.and if you're into it,we'll pull the trigger,we'll work on my contract and my salary,and then we'll getthings going from there.well, now's not the time to takeour foot off the gas, stevie,and if we have apublicist at our disposal.would we call her a publicist?um, i actually prefer to be called- a freelance brand invigorator.- hmm.and i also have a supereasy multi-step plan in placefor the motel.that sounds intense.um, maybe we should take aminute and think about this.well, i don't think there's any harmin exploring step 1 of the plan.that's great, because step 1 of the planwas this presentation, and we nailed it.so, as your new vp ofmarketing and communications,i'd say we're off to a great start.yeah.i'll pass.don't worry, moira,i'm not gonna ask you whetheri'm having a boy or a girl.wonderful.roland told me what happened today,i just feel terrible that youare in this sticky situation.don't worry, i've propelledit to the back of my brain.you must think that this is silly,but keeping the genderof the baby a secretis a bit of a traditionin roland's family.i believe he said so, yes.it goes way back. way, way back.salem, massachusetts, actually.yeah, his great-great-greatgreat-grandmotheraccurately guessed thesex of her daughter's baby,and then was put ontrial for witchcraft,- so, you would see why.- toil and trouble.roland never should've leftthat envelope on your desk.and now look at you,burdened with this secret.i mean, you must just wanna shout out"it's a boy!" or, "it's a girl!"- is it a girl?- valiant attempt, jocelyn.i was just testing you.i mean, i wouldn't wanna breakthe schitt family tradition.stupid witch!oh jocelyn, look at yourself.i know. i'm embarrassed by my behaviour.and you are being so strong, moira.i can't imagine justholding all that information,keeping it to yourself.veronica!she just have forgotten her handbag.i'm sorry, you weretalking about something?someone took a long coffee break.oh, i'm sorry, did imiss the evening rush?uh, yes, one customer came in,who was asking for directions.well, i have good news.i got us a permit for tomorrow night,and ronnie says that we canget around the liquor licenseif we just charge peoplecover at the door, so.what's the permit for?the open mic night.oh!so we're moving forward withthe open mic night, then.yeah! we're moving forward with it.people are pretty excited about it, too.did you know bob does beatpoetry in his spare time?no.oh god. um... what's that-what's that?this is called an acoustic guitar.right. okay,when we were talkingabout the open mic night,i thought that you would be hosting it,not performing at it.well, traditionally the hostplays at least one song, so.right. okay.so then you will be...playing your acoustic guitarin front of people then, in public.- and singing a song.- and singing a song.i was thinking aboutsinging an original song.- an original song?- but then i thought you know,it's probably best justto stick with a classic.yeah. classic.so i'm sensing some apprehension.no, i think it's, you know, it's...it's not scary or embarrassingfor the person you'redating to sing at youwith an acoustic guitarin front of people.i think that's cool.david, you're gonna be fine.it's just a way to get somepeople in the store, okay?yeah. yes, for sure.i mean, if you are, confident,to put yourself andour relationship at risklike that, then i am... 87% behind you.good to know. so nowthe only question is,- do i wear my fringed vest?- okay.or more importantly, doi wear anything under it?okay.okay, hi, hi.this image is gonnabe used as the key artfor the new website, so ithas to be like, on message.yes, uh, stevie, mr. rose,the motivation here istwo small-town friendswelcoming guests to their humble motel.oh. should i be holding a key?no, mr. rose, unless you wannalook really, really corny.yeah, like really, reallycheesy, and off-brand.all right, no key. no key.just look at the cameralike uh, it's a guest.if the camera was your guest,how would you greet her?i don't know.um, welcome to the schitt's creek motel.i'm johnny rose.um, yes, but no, don't use your mouth.uh, um, talk to theguests with your face.smile with your eyes.what the fuck does that mean?okay, johnny, what arewe doing with our hands?alexis, i don't loveyou calling me johnny.- okay, are we done here?- okay, it's probably my fault,but i don't think i'vegotten a good photo yet.yeah, something about thisis just not working for me.um, like can you...okay, um, mr. rose,would you mind takingone step to your left?okay now, three more steps to your left.so stevie, one other anglethat i'm playing isfocusing just on you.you're the hook.pretty country girl who doesn'tcare about big city thingslike... dressing well, or how she looks.we could rename the motellike, stevie's place.stevie's place sounds likea shelter for battered men.okay, well the name wasjust a jumping off point.um, we could use your last name,and call it the budd inn.and now that i'm saying that out loud,obviously we're not gonna do that.but i do wanna focus on you.is this a team meeting,'cause i'm part of the team.uh, no we're good, we'regonna focus on a solo shot.solo?don't take it personally, mr. rose,it's probably because you didn'tknow what to do with your hands.or maybe it's becauseyour face looked likeit tasted something sour. or maybe...thank you, ray, i get it.okay, actually, i'mreally not good with this.okay, stevie, you need more confidence,because this is all you.like literally anything.okay, i'm gonna need a minute.we didn't budget for that, but sure.attention everyone, aftermuch, much discussion,and a brief seance, rolandand i have decided...we wanna know the sexof our baby, moira!oh boy. uh, could we hold offuntil i get gwen on the phone?are we really still talking about this?ronnie, you don't have to stick around- if you don't want to.- no, no i'm in it now.well, i'm not so sure i am.knowing everything your greatgrandmother went through,i would... no, i willnot be held accountablefor invoking a coven.uh, gwen has stopped herpilates tape for this,so uh, can we get a move on here?very well, then.it's a girl.tammy!- or a boy.- huh?- perhaps it's a boy.- wait, which one is it?all of a sudden, expected attentionhas me doubting what i saw. ibarely glanced at that paper.no. no, i very clearly remember,an m and an f,just can't recall which one was circled.- well, could you try?- it's your fault!you told me to keep it a secret,and that's exactly whati did, even from myself.okay, well nobody panic.where did you put the sonogram?in the safe.and i wrote down the newcombination on a sticky note.perfect, so where's the sticky note?well, the sticky note, i believe,is also in the safe.well that, i will admit, is my blunder.gwen, you still there? hello?i'm goin' home.hey, so no presh,but the hot 10 i've given youhas turned into a very hot 20.yeah, i'm just a littleoverwhelmed right now.okay, um, babe, i get it.you're probably thinking like, oh,is my foundation off by a shade?am i wearing the wrong top?and the bottom line is, maybe.but you know what?so, i'm playing around with ray,we took some shots withmy hands outta my pockets,and he thinks with alittle photoshopping,they may turn out okay.- everything good here?- um, stevie has cold feet.okay, stevie, i know thisis a little overwhelming,but if you wanna grow the business,you gotta play the game.maybe i don't wanna play the game.maybe i don't wanna grow the business.okay, stevie, as vp, andceo of in-house publicity,growing the businessis generally consideredto be a good thing.right, but the morewe grow the business,the more money we make.and the more money we make,the more likely you are to take off,and then i will be left here stuck withway more responsibilitythan i ever asked for.what would make youthink i would walk awayfrom this business?aside from the fact that your wife- talks about leaving every day?- okay, sorry to jump in again,but this conversationseems like somethingwe should have hadbefore the photo shoot.stevie, whatever decisions we make,we make them together.nobody's gonna leave you behind.can i get that in writing?yeah. we can do that.okay, this is cute. this is cute.ray should be seeing this.ray! you should be seeing this.johnny's looking half-normal.- hi.- you see?you see what i told you?this is all
