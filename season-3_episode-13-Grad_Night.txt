like waiting to be hired.yeah. but you're learning.i know, but i'm takingsomeone's desk here.like someone who actuallywants to touch animals a lot.like...maybe there's a job out therethat i'm better suited for.and some other like gorgeous,slightly under qualifiedgirl is sitting at my deskasking herself the same question.okay...i'm just realizingthat wanting to come inand laugh at youranimal puns isn't enoughwhen there is like people here.those were genuine laughs?sometimes, yeah.well, i can't say thereception will be as fun,but... that's reallygenerous of you, alexis.like, surprisingly generous.no i know.so, um,i guess i should go.i have my graduation tonight, so.well, it's only eleven.and i am paying you for the day.i totally get that.i will stay until four.day ends at five, but

now fire up the 'no'in the 'no vacancy' sign.oh, yeah, that burnt out years ago.sadly it hasn't been an issue, but...maybe we could use the 'no'from the 'no refunds' sign.all right. we'll figure out.but i am so proud of our little team.up here. come on.i don't think we'rethose kind of people.in the sky! here we go!yeah! big day!big day, stevie!as long as we have some time,i thought we'd revisit thisdelightful little number.i can't even remember whywe stopped working on it.because we are an ensemble groupand this requires a lead vocalthat just happens to be in your range.ronnie,when one of us shines, all of us shine.that is the meaning of ensemble.sorry, gals.i just got caught up on the phone.i have good news and, and some bad news.oh. is the bad news thatthere is no good news?my aunt used to playthis game with me a lot.the good news is ijust got off the phonewith the little townsbig voices festivaland the elmdale songbirdshave had to drop outat the last minute.they got a terrible stomach fluthat just run right through them.so the festival was wonderingif the jazzagals would sub in tonight!oh, wow.and of course the bad news isthat moira and i won'tbe able to attend.oh. i'm sorry, w-why can't i?because your daughter isgraduating high school.oh. and what a grand night it will befor you and your charges.but the roses' willnot be at graduation.no, alexis has veritablybrowbeaten us not to attend.i wouldn't be surprised if sheskips the whole affair herself.waggish little nymph, that she is. so...well, then i guess it's just methat won't be making it to the festival.oh, jocelyn, don't worrywe will do you proud.i think we might just havethe perfect number for it.don't you think?â™ªwell, look at you...you are radiant.hardly.you are, alexis.oh, i'd advise
